## Armyworms

picture_counter_0 no image summary

Larvae of armyworms ( Mythimna unipuncta ), sometimes also called true armyworms, will feed on many different plants, including many crops. Adults are moths that do not overwinter in Manitoba, but move in from the south, and in some years can get to levels that can cause economic damage to crops. ## Host Crops

Lush grasses are preferred for egg laying. Armyworms will feed on wheat, oats, barley, fall rye, pasture and forage grasses, some grassy weeds and in grassy field borders. Armyworms may also feed on field and sweet corn, especially late-planted corn. Though larvae feed primarily on grasses, broad-leafed plants such as soybeans, beans, peas, canola, carrots and cabbage may also be fed on. Risk of feeding in broadleaf crops increases in fields where grassy weeds were present at the time of egg laying, or if they are moving in from adjacent crops they had fed on. Armyworms gets their name from the larvae's behavior of moving to new food sources in large groups. ## Identification

Larvae : The general body colour ranges from pale green while young, to dark greenish-brown to black for older larvae. On each side, larvae have long pale white, orange, and dark brown stripes running the length of their body. They have a yellowish brown head capsule with a brown network of veins, giving it a netted appearance, and a 'V' pattern on it. Armyworm larvae can also be distinguished by a dark band on the outer side of each proleg (the short, fleshy legs on the abdomen of caterpillars). Figure 1 .

Adults : The adult moths of armyworms have pale brown forewings, each with a single small white spot (Figure 4). picture_counter_3 no image summary

## Biology

The moths are active at night, feeding on nectar, mating, and searching for egg laying sites. Lodged plants provide a favourable habitat for moth concealment and egg laying. Adult female armyworms lay tiny, white eggs at night. Eggs are laid on lower leaves or at the base of grasses in narrow bands of a few to several hundred eggs, in two to five rows, rarely in one row.
