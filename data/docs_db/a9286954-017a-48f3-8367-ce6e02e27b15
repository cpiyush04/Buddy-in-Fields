Also look under plant debris, lumps of soil, and in soil cracks. When armyworms are found have a quick look at the back for eggs of parasites. Alternatively, late at night, with the aid of a flashlight, shake plants over a one-square metre area and count the dislodged larvae. It is not uncommon for there to be a range of larval sizes in a field. In cereal and grass crops, check at least five areas of a field in late June. Pay special attention to patches of lodged plants and areas of grassy weeds. Some birds (grackles and red-winged black birds) commonly search for armyworms in small grain. Any field or areas of fields that have significant bird activity should be scouted.
