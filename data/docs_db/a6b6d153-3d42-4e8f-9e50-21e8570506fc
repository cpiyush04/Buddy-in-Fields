developing fruits,  e.g. tomatoes. Damage from  thrips can  also  predispose  plants  to  fungal  or  bacterial infection, allowing a point of entry to the pathogen. ## Virus transmission

Some  thrips  may  also  vector  a  number  of  important plant viruses (Tospoviruses). Globally, tospoviruses are amongst  the most formidable of plant pathogens causing  severe  economic  losses  in  a  wide  range  of cultivated crops. The three tospoviruses found in Australian crops are Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), Capsicum  chlorosis  virus (CaCV)  and Iris  yellow  spot virus (IYSV). Four  species  of  thrips  transmit  these pathogens - WFT, tomato thrips and melon thrips. Refer to the  WFT factsheet for more information on Tospovirus symptoms of nursery crops and weeds. mature stages of thrips can acquire the virus, but the virus cannot complete the lifecycle within the insect, and  therefore  cannot  be  transmitted. A  larva  can acquire the virus in less than 30 minutes of feeding on  an  infected  plant. Once  the  larva  acquires  the virus,  it  circulates  and  multiplies  within  the  insect. When the  individual  becomes  an  adult  it  can  then readily  move  and  infect  any  susceptible  plant  on which it feeds for the rest of its life. The virus is not passed on to their offspring through the egg. ## Monitoring

Only  first  or  early  second  instar  larvae  feeding  on infected  plants  can  transmit  these  viruses. More

Plants susceptible to thrips damage should be inspected on a weekly basis for the presence of thrips and data  recorded,  preferably  electronically. Increase the frequency of monitoring during expected periods of infestation,  spring  and  summer,  particularly  during periods  with  strong  winds. Frequent  monitoring  will
