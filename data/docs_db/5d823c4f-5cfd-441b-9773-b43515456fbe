Advance cropping season and avoid staggered planting. 3. Growing resistant or early/short duration varieties if available in order to escape the peak incidence of thrips. 4. Clean cultivation - maintaining weed free bunds and borders of the crop fields since many weeds act as alternate hosts for thrips. 5. Seed treatment with label claim systemic insecticides. 6. Application of well decomposed farm yard manure (FYM) or compost  @  1  t/Ac,  enriched  with Metarhizium  anisopliae or Pseudomonas  fluorescens @  2  kg/t  along  with  recommended
7. doses of farm yard manure (10 to 12 t/Ac). 7. Soil application of 200 Kg of Neem cake and 500 Kg of vermicompost per acre to induce resistance against thrips
8. Balanced  fertilization  with  enhanced  potash  application  along with nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizers to induce plant resistance against the pest. 9. Mulching with silver coloured polythene sheets of 25-30 micron thickness to reduce pupation of thrips in the soil. 10. Border  cropping  with 2-3 rows  of tall growing  crops  like sorghum/  maize  /  bajra  /  fodder  grasses  etc. sown  thickly  as  a barrier for thrips movement. 11. Intercropping chilli with maize / sorghum and cowpea @ 10:3:1 as a barrier  and  reservoir  for  natural  enemy  multiplication, leading to biological control of thrips
12. Frequent inter cultivation  (earthing up/raking  of  soil)  operations to destroy soil inhabiting pupae of thrips
13. Mechanical  destruction  of  severely  infested  plants  by  uprooting and burying or burning.
