## Management strategies of

## Fall Armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda on maize

Monitoring: Installation of pheromone traps @ 5/acre in the current and potential area of spread in crop season and off-season. ## Scouting:

Start scouting as soon as maize seedlings emerge

1. At  Seedling to early whorl stage (3-4 Weeks after emergence)-  Action can be taken if 5% plants are damaged. 2. At Mid whorl to late whorl stage (5-7 weeks after emergence) -Action can be taken if 10 % whorls are freshly damaged in mid whorl stage and 20% whorl damage in late whorl stage. 3. At tasseling and post tasseling (Silking stage)Do  not spray chemical insecticides. Suitable bio-pesticide may be used in the event of ear/cob damage. ## Cultural Measures

1. Deep ploughing is recommended before sowing. This will expose FAW pupae to predators. 2. Timely  and  uniform  sowing  over  a  large  area  is  advised. Avoid  staggered sowings. 3. Intercropping of maize with suitable pulse crops of particular region. (eg. Maize + pigeon pea/black gram /green gram). 4. Erection  of  bird  perches  @  10/acre  during  early  stage  of  the  crop  (up  to  30 days). 5. Sowing  of  3-4  rows  of  trap  crops  (eg. Napier  )  around  maize  field  and  spray with    5%  NSKE  or  azadirachtin  1500  ppm  as  soon  as  the  trap  crop  shows symptom of FAW damage. 6. Clean cultivation and balanced use of fertilizers.
