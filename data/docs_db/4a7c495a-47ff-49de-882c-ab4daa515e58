In the last five instars, when larvae are disturbed they may rear their head and thorax and lash toward the annoying object before moving away. On the ground they usually curl up when disturbed (Figure 2). When mature, the larvae construct pupal chambers a few centimetres below the surface of the soil. The pupae (Figure 3) are about 20 mm (3/4 in.) long and reddish-brown in colour. The length of time as pupae also depends on temperature; about 9 days at a constant temperature of 29 degrees Celsius, and 24 days at a constant temperature of 17 degrees Celsius. There are usually two generations per summer in Canada with the first generation doing the greatest damage in late June and early July. Feeding habits : Early instar larvae skeletonize the surface of the leaf blades or the inner surface of the sheath, and later feed from the margins of the leaves, consuming all the tissues. The inflorescence is seldom damaged unless leaf foliage is scarce but in some grasses, notably timothy, the green heads are often consumed by the older larvae even when foliage is abundant. Armyworms do most of their feeding damage to cereals as nearly-mature larvae. Figure 4 . Adult moth of armyworm

## Scouting Techniques

Adults : Influxes of moths from the south, during May and June, can be monitored using pheromone-baited traps. Trap data can not be used to make management decisions, but can be used to guide scouting efforts for the larvae. Larvae in small grains and forage grasses : A common method of scouting for larvae is to check several areas of the field, and determine the number of larvae per square foot. Larvae hide during the day, which makes assessing levels more difficult. Notched leaves may be a sign that armyworms or other defoliators are or have been present. During the day, at each stop shake the plants and look on the soil for armyworm larvae.
