## Introduction

The Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) , is native to North America and was first described in 1824. It feeds on plants in the family Solanaceae including potato, pepper, tomato, tomatillo, eggplant, weeds such as the nightshades, and its native host buffalo bur. A preference for potato was discovered in Nebraska as the cultivated range overlapped with the native range of buffalo bur in the mid-1800's. Eastward expansion of populations quickly ensued and CPB reached the east coast by 1874. Today, CPB is considered a major pest of potato in the Northeast US. A similar beetle can commonly be confused with CPB and is called the false potato beetle, Leptinotarsa juncta . These are found in the midAtlantic and southeast US. False potato beetles feed almost exclusively on eggplant and are not considered a major pest in lesser numbers. As a pest of solanaceous plants, CPB has a special ability to rapidly develop insecticide resistance through gene regulation. Across various regional populations CPB has developed widespread insecticide resistance to all major chemical classes. Management of CPB relies on effective rotations of chemical modes of action, and cultural and biological control. ## Identification

Adults are convex beetles ~ 3/8 inch long by 1/4 inch wide. The adult thorax is orange with black spots and each wing cover has five yellowish white and five black alternating stripes running lengthwise (Fig. 1). The larvae are smooth, soft-bodied, humpbacked, and are reddish in color with two rows of black spots along each side (Fig. 2); Large larvae reach a length of ~1/2 inch. Eggs are yellow and deposited in masses resembling small sausages standing on end (Fig. 3). Figure 1. Adult Colorado potato beetle.
