2010). Timing of first appearance of H. zea in the United States varies with latitude, with emergence in April-June in the Carolinas (Caron et al. 1978, Roach 1981), May-June in Arkansas (Slosser  et  al. 1975),  April  in  North  Texas  (Eger  et  al. 1983),  and January-February in South Texas (Graham and Fife 1972). The first appearance in many parts of the United States likely results from migration, because H. zea is not thought to overwinter at latitudes greater than 40° (Hardwick 1965). The physiological potential for migratory flight was shown in a flight mill study using H. zea male moths caught in pheromone traps in Texas, with a total flight distance of 32.5 km (Beerwinkle et al. 1995). Migration plays an important role in the dispersal of H. zea , with movement strongly affected by weather patterns (Sandstrom et al. 2007). ## Injury to Corn and Impact on Yield

Leaf  injury  by H. zea feeding  can  occur  in  vegetative  stage  corn, though  this  type  of  injury  is  rare  (Quaintance  and  Brues  1905). The most common type of injury is caused by larval feeding in ears (Fig. 2)  and  has  been  reported  across  all  corn-growing  regions  in the United States (Bohnenblust et al. 2013, Reay-Jones et al.
