## European Corn Borer

picture_counter_0 no image summary

The European corn borer ( Ostrinia nubilalis ) was first discovered in North America in 1919 and in Manitoba in 1948. It belongs to a family of moths called the Crambid snout moths (Crambidae). It has been an economic pest in Manitoba corn fields on a sporadic basis. The European corn borer will feed on sweet, grain and silage corn. In addition, the European corn borer has a wide variety of other host plants including potatoes, hemp, quinoa, beans, millet, wheat and many species of large-stemmed flowers and weeds. In Manitoba there is only one generation of corn borer per year. In some years, as much as ten per cent of the population will attempt a second generation although this generation will be unsuccessful. Infestations in Manitoba are quite variable from year to year, with some areas experiencing heavy infestations, while other areas have little or no damage caused by European corn borer. ## Life History

The European corn borer has four stages in its life cycle. ## Adult

Adult moths are tan (female) or brown (male) with wavy lines on their wings (Figure 1). The male moths are darker, with darker markings than the female moths, and males are usually smaller than the females. The adult moths emerge from the pupae in late-June and early-July. They are strong fliers.
