If necessary, only use plants that have been tested and shown to be free of virus. 16. Plant non-host plants for a period of time to reduce the reservoir of virus on your property. This is particularly important if the virus has been continuously present for a relatively long period of time. 17. Insecticides will not always be able to manage aphidvectored viruses. Some viruses are transmitted by aphids when they insert their mouthparts into plants (but before they start feeding). This can occur in less than a minute. Insecticides may agitate individuals, increase their movement and therefore increase spread of the virus. ## BIOLOGICAL CONTROL

There are six natural enemies commercially available that consume or parasitise aphids; green lacewing, two ladybird beetles and three parasitoid wasps. The pirate bug ( Orius ) may also sometimes consume aphids. These products are available from Biological Services and Bugs for Bugs; these sites also have details on their biology. It is recommended to seek the advice of the biocontrol agent provider before releasing predators for the first time. Most of these predators are ideally suited to manage aphids between 15-30°C. Management using solely predators will be difficult above or below these temperatures. Some of the predators will only feed on a small number of species, others are more general (Table 1). Having pollen sources in the area has been shown to improve biological control across a range of situations and assists in establishment of predators that naturally move into the growing area. This is because natural enemies can feed on pollen as an alternative food source in between feeding or parasitising pests. It is also important to ensure that pesticides that are toxic towards predators have not been applied to the crop. A general summary of toxicity

to aphid parasitoids and predators is included in Table 3. Virtually all pesticides have some impact on predators and parasitoids, even those that do not kill them outright. For example, predators that feed or are otherwise exposed to low-risk, aphid-specific pesticides may have reduced longevity, feeding rates or egg laying compared to those that have not been exposed. In other words, they may not be as good at managing aphids as individuals that were not exposed to the pesticide. Table 1
