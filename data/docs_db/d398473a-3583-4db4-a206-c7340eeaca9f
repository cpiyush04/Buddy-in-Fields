But eventually their combined feeding kills the caterpillar. It is common to find hornworm larvae that have many white cocoons of Apanteles wasps on them. This is near the end of the parasitization process. From inside each cocoon, one tiny wasp emerges. White cocoons of Apanteles wasps are on this tabaco hornworm larva. picture_counter_6 no image summary

Gardeners regularly ask about killing the parasitized caterpillars. My policy is to kill or throw out any hornworm larvae I find on my tomato plants. If they have lots of wasp cocoons on them, I toss them far away, hoping at least some of the wasps will survive, but the caterpillar will have no more chance to eat my tomato foliage. If I see no cocoons on the larvae, I squash them. Small caterpillars eat relatively little leaf area, but the older ones consume huge quantities of foliage, and sometimes damage the fruit. To me, the best plan for controlling the larvae is to watch for the first tiny larvae, starting in early July. When I start seeing them, I treat my tomato plants with

a biological insecticide containing spores and protein crystals of a bacterium named Bacillus thuringiensis. There are insecticides with this killing agent that are approved for organic gardeners. They kill only caterpillars, and only when the caterpillars EAT the sprayed leaves. Treating tomato plants with an insecticide (aimed at controlling hornworms) earlier than July is wasteful, so I don't bother. In some years there are so few larvae, I don't have to treat at all.
