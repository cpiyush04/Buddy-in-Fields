after completing their larval development in order to fall to the ground, where they will form pupae and undergo metamorphosis. Cutting fruit open that contains feeding fruit fly larvae will reveal rotting fruit tissue where the larvae are feeding. ## MANAGEMENT

In Florida, only very ripe citrus fruit has been attacked by Caribfly. The other two species, which may attack fruit before ripening, are currently not present in the state. Therefore, although Caribfly is seen as a potential threat, it is not considered a major pest of citrus in Florida. However, as mentioned above, export regulations may mandate need for management. Fruit fly-free zones require that a designated area and buffer is maintained that is free of the preferred hosts of Caribfly (guava, loquat, rose apple and Surinam cherry), and trap surveys must demonstrate absence of flies in the designated area. Outbreaks of fly captures in traps in such areas may trigger management protocols, including application of bait sprays that combine a small amount of a short-lived toxicant with a protein and carbohydrate feeding stimulant for the flies. These sprays target adults, as eggs and larvae are afforded protection while developing within fruit. Much more intense eradication efforts would likely be implemented if populations of Medfly or Mexican fruit fly were detected in Florida. Other options that can be implemented in management of Caribfly (or the other two species) include mass release of sterilized males to outcompete natural males and crash fly populations, and reliance on biological control agents. picture_counter_3 no image summary
