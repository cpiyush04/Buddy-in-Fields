## COMPLY WITH REFUGE REQUIREMENTS. picture_counter_4 no image summary

*USDA estimate. Refuge requirements can be met in a variety of ways some are more convenient than others . The simplest of all is Refuge Advanced ®  where refuge seed is evenly distributed throughout the field during planting.'

## PROTECT THE YIELD. Dow AgroSciences offers broad-spectrum insect control to protect your investments and yield potential. These traits and technologies are available in our latest genetics. ## SELECT THE RIGHT TRAITS AND TECHNOLOGIES. This trait technology provides protection against a broad range of yield-robbing insects, including CRWs, through multiple modes of action . SmartStax offers higher yield potential and allows growers to protect more acres from damage caused by corn insects by enabling a 5 percent refuge in the Corn Belt and a 20 percent refuge in the Cotton Belt. POWERCORE combines three modes of action for protection against aboveground pests (not CRWs). If planted in an area with CRWs, other CRW protection will be required. This new trait technology is scheduled for introduction in 2015. This trait technology provides protection against above- and below-ground insects through a single mode of action for each. ## ENSURE REFUGE COMPLIANCE. This convenient, single-bag solution for refuge compliance requires no separate refuge in the Corn Belt** - because the refuge is in the bag. Just pour it into the planter, and Refuge Advanced meets the IRM corn refuge requirements on the acres where it is planted in the Corn Belt. To help protect the durability of today's advanced traits and preserve the technology for future generations, it's critical that growers practice good trait stewardship and comply with IRM requirements outlined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Planting a refuge is a basic practice of IRM and is required with all Bt -traited products. Hybrids in a refuge may be herbicide-tolerant but should not have Bt traits. Refuge requirements can vary by technology - the Product Use Guide for each technology shows acreage needed and configuration examples. **In cotton-growing regions, a separate 20 percent structured refuge is still required for Refuge Advanced.
