## Basic Biology and Life Cycle of BMSB

- In addition to being a conspicuous household nuisance pest in the winter and spring, BMSB is a serious agricultural pest of numerous crops during the summer months. - After emerging from shelters in late spring, BMSB adults begin mating and laying eggs on various trees and host plants in late May and June (Fig. 1). - In most of its range in North America, BMSB completes one to two generations per year, progressing through an egg stage and 5 nymphal instars before molting into a fully-winged adult (Fig. 2). ## Vegetable Crops at Risk / Crops Not at Risk

- BMSB is a landscape-level threat that frequently switches between host plants and can come from wooded habitats or among agricultural/settled land. - BMSB will attack most vegetables that bear reproductive structures, which they prefer to feed upon. - Among the vegetables, sweet corn (Fig. 3) and edible soybean (edamame) can incur extremely high densities of bugs during the kernel (or seed) development periods. - Okra and bell pepper (Fig. 4) are preferred host plants for the majority of the growing season and for reproduction because their indeterminate growth patterns typically provide fruiting structures from mid-July through September. - Green bean, tomato (Fig. 5), and eggplant also appear to support reproductive development of BMSB. - Sweet corn, green bean, bell pepper and tomato are very susceptible to feeding injury and typically experience higher injury rates from BMSB than eggplant or okra. - Asparagus and Swiss chard may be regularly attacked by BMSB. - BMSB appear to be only minor feeders on cucurbits such as squash and cucumber and brassica vegetables such as broccoli, and collards. - Leafy vegetables, root and tuber vegetables such as potatoes, and onions are not at risk to this pest.

## Vegetable Injury Diagnostics

- BMSB nymphs and adults injure vegetables by inserting their piercing-sucking feeding stylets into fruit, pods, buds, leaves, and stems. - In corn, BMSB stylets are inserted through the husk and pierce kernels, which may cause them to become sunken, collapsed, or discolored (Fig. 6). Damaged kernels appear dark brown after the corn ear is boiled. - Injury to fleshy fruit, like tomatoes and peppers, will produce white (on peppers; Fig. 7) or yellow (ripe tomato; Fig. 8) feeding marks on the skin and spongy tissue damage internally where the feeding occurred (Fig. 9). - Feeding on early fruiting stages can cause fruit abortion. - Bean pods (Fig. 10) and okra seed pods (Fig. 11) may be deformed or misshapen from BMSB feeding. - BMSB feeding can also open the path for secondary pathogens, further reducing the marketable yield. ## Period of Risk/Susceptibility

- In the mid-Atlantic U.S., the highest pest pressure to vegetables occurs in July and August. - Vegetable crops directly bordering woodlots are at the highest risk of attack as a large portion of the BMSB population disperses from wild tree hosts in the summer (Fig. 13). - Late plantings of vegetables that mature in September or later tend to have less BMSB pest pressure often because of BMSB moving to more attractive plants such as soybeans or various trees. ## Provisional Monitoring Recommendations

- Pyramid traps baited with commercial lures containing BMSB aggregation pheromone and methyl decatrianoate have been shown to be effective at catching BMSB even at low densities. These traps can be excellent monitoring tools for detecting BMSB activity on farms (Fig. 12). - Action thresholds have not yet been developed. ## Biological Control

- For most stink bugs, egg parasitoids are key natural enemies that keep pest populations in check. However, the native stink bug egg parasitoids found in North America do not develop well on BMSB and egg parasitism levels have been low in the midAtlantic U.S. - A number of generalist predators have been observed feeding on BMSB eggs and nymphs and play an important role in reducing pest densities (Fig. 14).
