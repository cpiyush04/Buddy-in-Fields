Manage sources of infestation: control broad-leaf weeds and reduce other alternative hosts in the production area and surrounds. The use of weed matting, plastic or gravel on the floor can help in nursery situations. Good weed management will also help reduce a variety of other pest problems including whiteflies, thrips and mealybugs. Print pictures of pests and beneficial species (either from a factsheet or from a web search on a particular species) and place them in a visible area, e.g. tea room or common area, to make staff more familiar with insects and mites on your property. 2. If necessary, establish wind breaks around the nursery, either with appropriate trees and shrubs or shade cloth to minimise the likelihood of aphids being blown into the crop. 3. Prune and thin plants with light to moderate infestations to reduce the pest load, increase airflow and access by insecticides. When pruning aphid infestations, be aware that some species drop off the plant when disturbed, e.g. rose aphid. Such species need to be treated with great care to avoid their spread while pruning and handling plants. 4. Remove and destroy heavily infested stock. Retaining unsaleable stock provides a source of further infestation. Infested material should be bagged and deep buried or placed in a black bag in the sun for several hours to kill pests. Leaving unbagged, infested plants or cuttings in the bin encourages pests to reinfest the property, particularly when winged aphids are present. 5.
