Hand  picking  and  destruction  of  egg  masses  and  neonate  larvae  in  mass  by crushing or immersing in kerosine water. 2. Application  of  dry  sand  in  to  the  whorl  of  affected  maize  plants  soon  after observation of FAW incidence in the field. 3. Application of Sand + lime in 9:1 ration in whorls in first thirty days of sowing. 4. Mass trapping of male moths using FAW specific pheromone traps @ 15/acre. ## Bio Control:

1. In situ protection of natural enemies by habitat management: Increase the plant diversity  by  intercropping  with  pulses,  oil  seeds  and  ornamental  flowering plants which help in build-up of natural enemies. 2. Augmentative release of egg parasitoid Trichogramma pretiosum or Telenomus remus @  50,000  per  acre  at  weekly  intervals  or  based  on  trap  catch  of  3 moths/trap. 3. Bio-pesticides:  If  infestation  level  is  at  5%  damage  in  seedling  to  early  whorl stage  and  10%  ear  damage,  then  use  following  entomopathogenic  fungi  and bacteria
4.  Bacillus thuringiensis v. kurstaki formulations @ 2g/l (or) 400g/acre. 5.  NPV
6.  EPN
