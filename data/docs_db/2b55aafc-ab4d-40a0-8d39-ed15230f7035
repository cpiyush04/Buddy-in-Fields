2014,  Reay-Jones and Reisig 2014, Reay-Jones et al. 2016). However, in addition to yield, grain quality can be improved by protecting ears from H. zea injury using Bt corn. Fumonisin contamination  in  corn  ears  can  be  reduced  in  Bt  hybrids  compared  with non-Bt isolines (Dowd 2001, Wu 2006). Reduction in fumonisin concentrations in Bt corn hybrids expressing Cry1Ab has been shown to occur when O. nubilalis is the predominant pest (Munkvold et al. 1999, Clements et al.
