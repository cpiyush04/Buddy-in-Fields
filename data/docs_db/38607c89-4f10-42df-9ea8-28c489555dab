littoralis ). ## Host Plants

The genus Spodoptera is extremely polyphagous, with individual species feeding on a wide range of plant species and families. The species S. frugiperda has been reported feeding on 353 different plant species from 76 families, these are mainly grasses and cereals such as maize, sorghum and rice, but it also feeds on members of the Asteraceae (daisies and sunflowers) and Fabaceae (peas and beans). Due to this ability to feed on a wide range of plants Spodoptera species are some of the most important Lepidopteran (moths and butterflies) pests in many countries around the world. <!-- page_break -->

## Description

The caterpillars of Spodoptera are very similar in appearance and are difficult to tell apart without laboratory examination. Individuals are extremely variable; it is not uncommon for individual caterpillars from the same egg mass to look completely different from one another (Fig 2). The eggs are laid in clusters, usually on the underside of a leaf, but also occasionally other surfaces and structures. The female covers the eggs with hairs and scales from her underside giving them a yellow to light brown furry 'felt-like' appearance (Fig 3). Upon hatching, the newly emerged caterpillars are very similar in appearance to many other newly hatched caterpillars. They are 2-3 mm long with white/clear bodies and black heads and are very difficult to see (Fig 4). At this stage they are very mobile and after a quick initial feed they disperse. The overall colour of the later stages of the caterpillars can vary from green to a light or dark brown, and the body is usually strongly speckled with tiny white spots. Caterpillars soon develop characteristic markings on their backs. These often include: a square of four yellow spots, each on a black patch, located just behind the head. The four yellow spots are very characteristic for species that are most likely to be encountered such as the Asian cotton leafworm ( S. litura ) and S.
