## MANAGEMENT OF FRUIT FLIES: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH

## Abstract

Fruit  flies  are  the  most  notorious  pests of  horticultural  commmodities  throughout  the world. Being  ubiquitous  in  distribution,  these flies are reported from almonst all agroclimatic conditions  of  the  world  and  are  regarded  as pests  of  international  significance. The  high reproductive potential, polyphagous nature and ability  to  adapt  to  varied  clinmatic  conditions has  made  fruit  flies  a  very  difficult  pest  to manage. A single management tactic  does not provide  effective  control  of  the  pest,  hence different  methods  need  to  be  integrated  to achieve  desired  level  of  contol. The  present chapter provides information on different management  options  available  along  with  the level of control achieved with each option. Fruit  flies  belong  to  one  of  the  largest family  Tephritidae  of  the  order  Diptera. The fruit flies are ubiquitous in distribution occupying regions from tropical, subtropical to temperate regions of the world. There  are nearly  4500  species  of  fruit  flies  under  the family Tephritidae reported throughout the world with 400 species of fruit flies under the genus  Bactrocera  (David  and  Ramani,  2011). The  tephritidits are identified by  the three costal breaks in the wing at the humeral subcostal and costal vein. The size of the fruit flies differs and is affected by the host (Sharma and Gupta 2018b). Fruit flies belonging to the genus Bactrocera are the most devastating pests of fruit  and  agricultural  commodities throughout the world. The change in the climatic conditions has provided adaptive advantage to these fruit flies resulting in frequent outbreaks in various fruit crops (Sultana  et  al.,  2017). Fruit  flies  affect  the quality and quanity of the fruits therby affecting their production and market potential and  leading  to  about  40-  80  percent  crops losses (Kibira et al 2015).

Fruit flies are responsible for more restrictions on produce movement than any other pest. These  are  most  widely  distributed,  there  are  a  number  of  different  species  that  raise quarantine concerns.Since they can be easily transpoted across the nations through contaminated  fruit  commodities,  countries  harbouring  these  pests  invest  great  amounts  to control the pest and also has trade sanctions imposed (Sharma and Thakur, 2007; Sharma et al, 2009). The European union and US has imposed restriction on the import of fresh fruits from fruit fly reported countries and fruits from such countries can only be imported after nuclear irradiation and strict quarantine inspection  (Dhami et al 2016; Rastogi and Deodhar 2008; Reddy et al 2010). The fruit flies are a very difficult pest to mange as the damaging stages remain  hidden  in  the  fruit  nad  the  full  grown  larvae  fall  to  the  ground  for  pupation  thus escaping  the  insecticide  contact  (Heve  et  al,  2017). Moreover  most  of  the  countries  have imposed  ban  oin  the  earlier effective broads  spectrum  insecticides used  for fuit fly mangement. (Bockmann  et  al,  2014). The  increasing  concern  among  the  people  and enviornmentalists for pesticidfree food has compeled the scientists and researchers to serach for alternative fruit fly mangement options (Navarro-llopis et al, 2011). The high adaptation potential, polyphagous nature and higher reproductive potential makes  it  a  very  difficult  pest  to  manage  and  cannot  be  dependent  on  a  single  option  but requires the integration of various management options. Therefore the chapter highlights the impotant integrated fruit fly mangemnt options for reducing the menance of fruit flies. ## I. BIOLOGY OF THE PEST AND CORRECT TAXONOMIC IDENTIFICATION

The effective management of fruit flies require the proper knowledge pertaning to the biology of the pest so that the weak links in the life cycle of the pest can be targeted. The fruit flies makes punctutre in the fruit with the help of its ovipositor and deposits the eggs in the fruits. The maggots after completion of the incubation hatch from the eggs and  statrt feeding. The maggots during the first instar are delicate and with the help of the mouth hooks feed on the fruit pulp. After completion of the second instar the maggots moult into the third instar, which is the major feeding stage of the pest. Once these third instar maggots becomes fully feed they  leave  the  rotting  fruit  and  fall  to  the  ground  for  pupation. The  larval  skin  of  the third instar becomes hard to form the puparium in which the maggots pupates. The adult flies emerge from the puparium by cutting a hole in it. Several generations are completed in a year depending on the host availability and favourable conditions (Sharma, 2018). Identification of the fruit fly species is an important aspect of fruit fly mangement as the fruit flies infesting the  vegetables  are  attracted  to  cuelure  whereas  those  found  in  fruits  are  generally  trapped using  methyl  eugenal. The  monitoring  and  identification  are  most  important  aspect  in  the mangement  of  fruit  flies  (Aluja,  1999). Monitoring  of  fruit  fly  population  helps  us  to determine  the  population  of  fruit  flies  present  and  evaluate  effectiveness  of  different mangement strategies (Eliopoulos, 2007). The different management strategies for fruit fly control are mentioned as under :

1. Cultural Control: Managing of fallen fruits is the first and foremost step for controlling the fruit fly infestation. The fallen fruits should in collected and dumped in a pit 50 cm deep and should be covered with soil to ensure cleanliness. The fallen fruits on the ground

severe as a breeding site for the multiplication  of  the fruit flies. These fallen fruits can also be placed in plastic bags and exposed to sunlight (Reddy, 2020). Higher density of B. invadens was found on fallen fruits than from the fruits on the tree, which highlights the importance of orchard santitation practises for effective fruit fly management (Rwomushana, 2008). The use of black plastic bags has also shown much importance in mangemet of fruit flies. The fallen fruits were placed in black plastic bags and were hung in sun until the fruits rot and the maggots dies. This method was found effective for the mangement  of B. zonata in  Egypt  (Mohamed  and  El-wakkad,  2003). The  varying temperature regimes and internal conditions were studied in mango crop, it was observed that  the  damaged  mango  fruits  in  the  shade  favoured  better  internal  conditons  for  the growth of the larvae than the mangoes which were present in the sun (Jenkins et al, 2008). Since fruit flies prefer semi-ripened fruits for egg laying, early harvesting of fruits can also help in lowering the pest population. The harvesting of fruits like banana, mango and oranges should be done at an early stage to avoid damage caused by fruit flies (Badii et al 2015; Sidique et al, 2017). The selection of variety can also have impact in reduction of  fruit  infestation. Since  the  maximum  infestation  by  fruit  flies  was  recorded  in  late summer and autumn maturing  varieties  hence  selection  of  early  maturing  varieties  can help to manage the attack (Sidique et al, 2017). Further a well managed orchard has less infestation  in  comparison  to  an  unmanged  ones  as  the  intercultural  operations  can  be easily carried out. When effect of pruning from May to Sptember in guava was conducted and was compared with orchards with no pruning, it was  observed that minimum fruit infestation  was  observed  in  trees  pruned  in  September  (9.94%),  being  at  par  with infestation in trees pruned in August (11.87 %). Whereas, the maximum infestation was observed in unpruned tress (48.11 %) (Choudhary et al ,2022). 2. Mechanical  Control: The  mechnaical  methods  to  prevent  fruit  infestation  by  the  flies includes  the  use  of  protective  covers  such  as  screens  and  nets  to  avoid  contact  of  fruit flies  with  the fruit. The  method of  wrapping of the fruits  using protective coverings is more effective but wrapping of the fruits is a labour inntensive method and require more cost. Wrapping is usually carried out 1 month earlier to prevent the female fruit flies from laying eggs (Badii et al, 2015). Behavioural Control: Behavioural control involves the methods which interfere with the normal behavioural aspects of the pest. This inclues use of Pheromones and Sterile insect Technique. -  MAT: The  pheomones  are  used  to  attract  the  males  of  the  fruit  flies. The  Male annihilation technique (MAT) is mostly used which is a strategy to kill the male flies by  luring  them  with  help  of  a  chemical  and  killing  the  attracted  males,  thereby reducing the availability of the male to mate with the females. When combined with other control strategies MAT can result in eradication of the  fruit flies (Dominiak and Nicol, 2012;Dominiak, 2019). Traps and lures have been used for the mangemnet of fruit flies from over a decade. The first attractant developed for the male fruit flies was Methyl Eugenal by Howlett in 1912 for attracting the males of Bactrocera zonata (Verghese et al, 2013). There  after  different  lures  were  developed  by  various  workers  such  as  kerosene,

<!-- page_break -->

Angelica  seed  oil  and  trimed  lure  for  Mediterranean  fruit  fly, Ceratitis  capitata management. Studies for attractiveness of Cuelure for the mangement of Bactrocera cucurbitae was demonstrated by Beroza and Green (1963). The MAT blocks aree made up of materials such as pastic or wood (Lloyd et al, 1998, Thakur and Gupta, 2013). The tephritid fruit flies have been managed with the  use  of  MAT  for  decades  in  various  parts  of  the  world. The  eradication  of B. papayae was carried out using Methyl eugenal based traps in Rota, Okinawa Islands and NorthQueesland (Steiner et al 1965; Koyama et al, 1984 and Lloyd et al, 1998). The peach fruit fly B.zonata was eradicated from Egypt (Ghanim et al, 2010) and B. dorsalis in  Kenya (Ndlela et al, 2020) and the Zeugodacus cucurbitae from  Hawaii (Spafford et al, 2018). The MAT blacks are impregnated with the mixute consisting of alcohol, lure and insecticide. These blocks are then placed in a bottle of any contanier so that the flies  attracted  and  killed  are  collected  in    the  container. The  chemical  lures  used  to attract  the  males  are  Culure  (CL)  and  Methyl  eugenol  (ME)(Bateman  et  al.,  1966), whereas for a number of years Malathion has been used as a toxicant due to its long activity  under  field  conditions  (Lioyd  et  al  1998  and  Thomas  and  Meats  1999), however  due  its  toxicity  and  restricted  use  is  being  replaced  by  spinosad  (Sharma, 2018  and Abrol  et  al,  2019). The  effectiveness  of  the  MAT  is  affected  severly  by decline in the effectiveness of lure or toxicant (Llyod et al, 1998; Vargas et al 2015; Manoukis et al, 2019). MAT fails to provide complete control of the fruit flies due to the  lack  of  community  participation  and  unwillingness  among  the  farmers  for installation  of  traps. Often  the  MAT  is  combined  with  other  techniques  such  as  the sterile insect release and protein baits where irradication is the main objective. As the pheromones are unstable in nature and under go auto-oxidation, photooxidation  and  isomerization  and  volatility  (Cok,  2004),  the  pheromones  when  used under field conditons need to be stable. One answer to this problem can be the use of nanogel  immobilized  pheromones. It  was  observed  that  the  nanogel  were  quite effectivw in the control of fruit flies with higher residual activity and also were found effective during the unfavourable conditions (Bhagat et al., 2013). -  SIT: Sterile  Insect  Technique  (SIT),  according  to  the  International  Plant  Protection Convention  (FAO,  2005)  is  defined  as  a  method  of  pest  control  using  area-wide inundative releases of sterile insects to reduce fertility of field population of the same species. The technique involves the mass rearing of sterile insects and releasing the same in the enviornment for mating with the females in the wild. This will result in failure of production of off springs by the femlae. The SIT was successfullly used for the first time by Knipling in 1955 (Knipling, 1955) for the eradication of a cattle pest screwworm, Cochliomyia  hominivorax Coqerel  from  North  and  Central  America (Klassen  and  Curtis,  2005). Since  then  SIT  has  been  used  for  the  eradication  of  a number of agriculturally and veterinary pests from around the world. Since the 1950's this technique has been used for control of fruit flies from different parts of the world such as Bactrocera cucurbitae Coquillett  from Japan (Kuba  et al 1996) Queesland fruit fly Bactrocera tyroni Froggatt from Western Austrailia (Sproule et al, 1992),  Mediterranean  fruit  fly, Ceratitis  capitata from  California  and  Florida,  USA

(Dowell  et  al  2000;  Barry  et  al,  2004),  Hawaii  (Steiner  et  al,  1970),  Mexico (Hendrichs et al, 1983) and Chile (Gonzalez and Troncoso 2007). SIT    is  a  scientifically  sound  management  technique  which  is  used  for  the control  of  pests    and  can  also  be  used  to  establish  fruit  fly  free  zones  (Reddy  et  al 2016). With the advancement in technology, Artificial intenlegence is now being used for  identification  of  the  treated  flies  from  the  normal  flies  (Gonzalez-Lopez  et  al, 2022). The favourable effect of the SIT program estimated in terms of the benefit cost ratio achieved  was 150 in Mexico and US and as high as 1600 and 1900 : 1 in Chile and South California respectively (Lindquist and Enkerlin, 2000). It was only after the eradication of the melon fruit fly from Japan that it was able to export horticultural products in the international market (Kakazu, 2002). SIT is the only technique which provides high economic retuns. ## II. BIOLOGICAL CONTROL

Parasitoids  among  the  biological  control  strategy  are  mostly  exploited  for  fruit  fly mangement (Vargas et al 2012; Dias et al, 2018). The papasitoids in the Braconidae family includes Diachasmimorpha  longicaudata    Diachasmimorpha  longicaudata  and  Psyttallia spp. Such as P. concolor, P . fletcheri and  P . ponerophaga ( Mohamed et al 2008; Montoya et al 2016; Ovruski and Schliserman, 2012). The parasitoid was also reported from the mango growing regions of Himachal Pradesh, India (Sharma, 2018). The ability of D. longicaudata to  settle  in  diverse  semiarid  and  tropical  enviornments  allowed  the  mangement  of  the pestiferous Anastrepha sp. in Brazil (Garcia et al, 2013). The parasitoid, D. longicaudata has also  been  used  for  the  augmentative  location-extensive  release  in  various  Mexican  states (Montoya et al 2007; Montoya et al, 2020). D. longicaudata was  also  used in  Peru  for  the control of C. capitata resulting in more than 50 per cent parasitism in 2 years (Gracia et al, 2020). Apart  from  these  the  egg-  larval  parasitiod Fopius  arisanus ,  larval  parasitoid D. Tyroni,  D. fullaway i  and  the  pupal  parasitoid Coptera  silvestri was  also  used  for  the management of fruit flies, especially C capiata (Clausen, 1978). The  entomopathogenic  fungi  have  also  been  used  for  the  mangemnt  of  fruit  flies resulting  in  stimulating  effects. Beauveria  bassiana,  Metarhizium  anisopliae and Isaria fumosorosea resulted  in  90-100  per  cent  motrtlaity  of Rhagoletis cerasi (Daniel  and Wyss, 2009). The  foliar  application  of B. bassiana reduced  the  fruit  fly  species  by  65  per  cent. (Daniel and Wyss, 2010). The entomopathogenic species provided promising results for the management of C. capitata , Bactrocera oleae and Z. cucurbitae (Castillo et al, 200; Yousef et al, 2013; Toledo et al., 2017;  Yousef et al., 2014; Sookar et al 2017). Recently, autoinoculative devices and sterile male vectors were tested using three strains of B. bassiana for the control of C. capitata in coffee (Toledo et al, 2017). The release of the male vectors was a better transmitting agent of the conidial spores. EPNs have also been used under laboratory conditions like Steinernema carpocapsae Weiser (Neoaplectana carpocapsae) was found to cause significant mortality in melon fruit fly  after  6  days  of  exposure  at  5000-5,000,000  nematodes/cup,  and  an  average  of  87.1% mortality in the field when applied at 500 infective juveniles/cm2 of soil (Lindegren, 1990). <!-- page_break -->

Table 1 summarizes the natural enemies of fruit flies and the stages that are affected. The two main species used for the mangement of fruit flies include Heterorhabditis spp. (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae) and Steinernema spp. (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae). The entompthoagenic nematodes have been successfully used for the mangement  of A. fraterculus, A. ludens, A. suspensa Dacus ciliatus  and R. cerasi (Kamali et al 2013; Foelkel et  al  2017;  Have et al ,2016; Torrini et al, 2017). These workers suggested the mortality of fruit  flies  with  EPNs ranged from 14-96 per cent and were also influenced by a number of factors. ## III. CHEMICAL CONTROL OF FRUIT FLIES

The management of fruit flies  with chemicals has been an age old practice and the most commonly followed practice by the farmers. The first chemical to be used for the fruit fly management was DDT and was slowly replaced by organophosphate insecticides Gupta and verma (1978). In  Bait  Application  technique  (BAT),  sprays  consisting  of  mixture  of  Bait  and insecticide    are  applied  in  the  form  of  spot  application. Baits  such  as  protein  solutions, fermented sugar solutions, vinegar and fruit juices have been used since 1918 for the capture of females (IAEA 2003). The bait sprays are applied as spot application which is known to reduce the fruit fly population upto 90 per cent with a cost benefit ratio of 1:9.1 (Ekesi, 2016). This method is  an advantageous alternative to the chemical application of insecticide cover sprays (Jenkins and Sheldy  1959;  Allwood,  1989). The  mixture  of  water, bait (protein hydrolysate)  and insecticide  are  used  in  the  ratio  of  98.6,  0.7:  0.7. this  technique  is  relatively  save  in comparison to the application of the insecticide alone and is less harmful to the  non-target organisms. The combination of MAT and BAT provides added advantage for the mangmeent of  fruit  flies  (Patel  and  Mondal,  2011). Both  MAT  and  BAT  cannot  control  the  damage caused by fruit flies, they can only be effective when used with other control methods. The MAT when used with Sterile insect Technique  has  been found effective  in  irradication    of fruit flies from various islands. The mangement of fruti flies using either baits or as cover spray both can result in the development  of  resitance. The  development  of  resitnce  in  insect  can  result  either  from mutations of the tatget site due to the detoxification of the insecticide molecule. B. cucrbitae and  B. dorsalis  were  reported  to  show  resitance  to  DDT  nad  methoxy  chlor  from  Hawaii. Additionally, B. oleae, B. dorsalis and C. capitata have shown resistance to organophosphate insecticides (Nigg et al 2008; Vontas 2018; Hsu et al, 2008). Nigg et al (2008) also reported the  resistance  of  A,  suspensa  to  malathion  from  Taiwan,  similarly C. capitata was  also reported to be resistance to malathion from Spain (Magana et al, 2008). ## Quarantine Treatments

1. Cold Storage: Cold storage is commonly used as a quarantine treatment for fruit crops against fruit flies. Temperatures under 3°C are required for 2 weeks or more. This limits use on chilling sensitive vegetables. <!-- page_break -->

2. Heat Treatments: Heat treatments are used as a quarantine treatment against fruit flies in chilling sensitive fruit crops. 3. Fumigation: There are a number of different fumigants, of which methyl bromide is still widely accepted. It is cheap to apply, fast and can be used as a generic treatment against a range of pests. 4. Irradiation: it is fast, accepted as a generic treatment for fruit fly and leaves no residue. ## IV. NEW INSECTICIDES

The  high  degree  of  resistance  to  popularly  used  insecticides  has  compeled  the researchers  to  search  for  alternatives. Spinosad  has  provided  efffective  control  of  the  fruit flies in mango (Sharma and Gupta 2018a, Sharma 2018). Rahman et al (2019) also reported the  effectiveness  of  spinosad  andabamectin  in  fruit  fly  management. In  addition,  botanical based pesticides not only provide effective control of the fruit  flies (Singh 2003; Silvia et al 2013) but can also be integrated with other parasitoids (Alvarenga et al, 2012). The utilization of spinosad in bait sprays has also provided good control of fruit flies (Michaud, 2003; Flores et  al,  2011). Alam  and  Khan  (2021)  suggested  the  efficacy  of  spinosad  in  amangement  of cucurbit fruit fly in bottle gourd. El-Gendy et al (2021) suggested the efficacy of abamectin as  soil  treatment  for  the  control  of  peach  fruit  fly, B. zonata . Sharma  and  Gupta(2018) reported  better  efficacy  of  spinosad  than  the  popularliy  used  insecticide  malathion  and azadirachtin in mangement of B. dorsalis and B. zonata . Jagarat et al (2023) also reporteed the efficacy of spinosad in management of fruit flies in bitter gourd. ## V. CONCLUSION

Studies on fruit flies which started from as early as 1950's even continue till date as management of this pest is not only difficult but the threat of its introduction to new regions is a cause of concern. The dependance on a sole management tactic cannot control the pest hence integration of diffferent methods needs to be done. Moreover, the scientist will keep searching for alternatives and integration of different management  options until the management of the female fruit flies is achieved. ## REFERENCES
