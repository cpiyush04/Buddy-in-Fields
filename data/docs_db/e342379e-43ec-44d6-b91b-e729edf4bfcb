1991). Kring et  al. (1993)  showed  that  pupal  mortality  from  natural  enemies was  limited  in  trials  in  Arkansas  and  recommended  that  classical biological control  programs  therefore  be  implemented. Predators  include Harpalus  pennsylvanicus DeGeer  (Lesiewicz et  al. 1982)  and Orius insidiosis (Say)  (Reid  1991),  in  addition to  birds  (Mott  and  Stone  1973). Entomopathogenic  nematodes have been suggested to be important natural enemies of H. zea , including Steinernema riobravis Cabanillas, Poinar, and Raulston in Arkansas (Feaster and Steinkraus 1996) and Texas (Cabanillas and  Raulston  1996). Nucleopolyhedroviruses  (NPV)  can  infect H. zea and be applied as biopesticides to reduce pest populations (Pingel and Lewis 1999, Lacey et al. 2001). Advantages of NPVs can include specificity for target pests and elevated rates of infection,  and  field  trials  in  Mississippi  showed  the  potential  of  this method to reduce H. zea populations (Hardee et al. 1999). While widespread adoption of NPVs holds potential as a tool to reduce populations of H. zea , current use of transgenic Bt crops has likely hindered the development and use of microbial control methods. While a complex of natural enemies can affect H. zea , the impact on H. zea dynamics are generally not sufficient to prevent it from being the most common Lepidopteran pest of corn in many parts of the United States. ## Insecticides

The use of foliar insecticides to manage this pest in corn is challenging, as larvae quickly burrow into the silks and become protected within the ears (Widstrom et al. 1976). Kernel injury still occurred in non-Bt corn hybrids despite intensive applications (13-18 per trial) of chlorantraniliprole (a highly effective insecticide in other crops) in trials in North and South Carolina (Reay-Jones and Reisig 2014). Similarly, applications of flubendiamide or chlorantraniliprole from silk emergence to silk senescence every 1-2 d only reduced kernel injury from ~7.1 kernels per ear in untreated plots to ~2.5 kernels per ear in treated plots in trials in Mississippi and Georgia with a Bt hybrid expressing Cry1F (Bibb et al. 2018). Intensive insecticide usage is  undoubtedly cost prohibitive for field corn producers intending to eliminate corn earworm injury, and, as such, published data are limited on insecticide efficacy for H. zea control. In contrast, tolerance for H. zea injury to ears in sweet corn is low, particularly for fresh market sweet corn (Shelton et al. 2013). Timing of insecticides is crucial, as insecticides need to be applied at short intervals during silking  to  prevent H. zea larvae  from  reaching  the  ear. Synthetic (carbamate, diamide, oxadiazines, pyrethroids, and spinosyns) and biologically based insecticides (mainly Bt) are used in sweet corn to manage H. zea (Shelton et al. 2013). ## Management Using Transgenic Bt Hybrids

## History and Efficacy

The use of transgenic Bt corn hybrids can reduce injury from H. zea , though complete control is not achieved with most Bt traits (Buntin et  al. 2004,  Reay-Jones  and  Reisig  2014). Bt  corn  was  first  introduced in 1996 to control the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner), and other stalkboring species (Koziel et al. 1993). The first Bt corn hybrids expressed a single toxin (Cry1Ab or Cry1F) and provided excellent control of stalkborers, but only poor to fair levels of control of H. zea (Buntin et al. 2004, Reay-Jones et al. 2009, ReayJones  and  Reisig  2014). For  example,  hybrids  expressing  Cry1Ab reduced kernel injury by 67% in South Carolina in 2007-2009 (ReayJones  et  al. 2009),  30%  across  12  southern  states  in  2010-2011 (Reisig et al. 2015), and 51% in trials in North and South Carolina in 2012-2013 (Reay-Jones and Reisig 2014). Hybrids expressing Cry1F reduced kernel injury by 39% in trials across four southern states in 2007-2009 (Siebert et al. 2012), 14% across 12 southern states in 2010-2011 (Reisig et al. 2015), and 30% control in trials in North and South Carolina in 2012-2013 (Reay-Jones and Reisig 2014).
