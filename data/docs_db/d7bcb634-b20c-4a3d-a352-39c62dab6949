 Caterpillars have a dark head with a pale, upside down Y-shaped mark on the front  Big caterpillars have four raised dark spots that form a squared pattern on the 2 nd to last segment when seen from above  Caterpillars can live for 12-20 days depending on temperature and other environmental conditions |           |
| Pupa                           |  The pupa is reddish brown in colour and forms a cocoon of about 20 -30mm in length and is oval in shape mostly found in the soil in 2-8cm deep  Pupa lives 12-14 days before the moth emerges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |           |
| Adult                          |  The moth is grey-brown in color  The male moth has conspicuous white spots on the tip and center of the forewings. The forewings are grey and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Male moth |

-  It will live 2-3 weeks before dying
-  Migratory and can travel long distances

## a) Symptoms of pest damage

1. Check  for  small  to  large  irregular  and  elongated  holes  on  the  leaves. Window  panes  of translucent  patches  are  cause  by  small  FAW  in  the  1 st -  2 nd instars  while  large  irregular elongated holes on leaves are caused by big FAW in the 3 rd - 6 th instars. 2. Sawdust-like material ('frass') in the maize funnel or on the leaves, tassels and cobs showing heavily infestation in the plant. ## C) Control measures

The best and most effective strategy for managing  FAW is taking preventive measures and immediate action when the Fall armyworm is detected. The action taken will be guided by the extent  of  infestation. After  monitoring  and  recording  the  number of  maize  plants affected  by FAW, the chart below can help you make a decision about the most appropriate management option. The FAW can cause more damage to maize at the early growth stage, which is why the threshold for the use of pesticides is higher than in older maize crops

## Cultural control methods/mechanical control methods

1. Destroy the eggs, larvae and pupae in the crop residues after harvest by deep burying  the plant residues in soil (at least 12cm deep). 2. Practice  crop  rotation. Alternate  maize  with  crops  that  are  not  attacked  by  the  FAW  e.g. cassava

3. Intercropping with pigeon pea, beans, groundnuts can attract more beneficial insects, and can help repel FAW from your garden and control other weeds
4. If you notice the number of eggs or caterpillars are few, handpick and crush them. This is only practical for small gardens or few affected plants.
