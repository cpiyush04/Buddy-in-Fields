Some growers prefer to hand pick the larvae. Be my guest. But you will find that their counter-shading makes them very hard to find, so you will spend a long time and still miss many of them. The larvae that you miss continue to eat the foliage. To me, spraying a B.t. product is much less work, and more effective. One clue to the presence of a caterpillar is the damp frass pellets on the ground. When fresh, the pellets are moist &amp; dark. Little caterpillars create little pellets. BIG ones create BIG pellets. There are plenty of chemical pesticides available to kill the caterpillars. There are so many, I won't bother to list them. The pesticide label will indicate whether or not the product controls hornworms. This species is easier to kill with pesticides when the larvae are small, and harder to kill when the larvae are large. The fecal pellets are dark, knobbed and barrel-shaped. picture_counter_7 no image summary
