## CITRUS PEST SPOTLIGHT

## Fruit flies

## By Lukasz Stelinski

F ruit flies can be very important pests of citrus in various parts of the world. Fortunately, the more damaging species are not established in Florida. The species that does sporadically occur in Florida is the Caribbean fruit fly ( Anbastrepha suspensa , Fig. 1), commonly referred to as 'Caribfly.' Caribfly is not a direct threat to citrus production in Florida; however, export restrictions to certain markets, both domestic and foreign, may require management to maintain so-called 'fly-free zones' to produce fruit for export. Another fruit fly species that is a pest of citrus is the Mediterranean fruit fly ( Ceratitis capitata ) or 'Medfly.' The medfly is considered the most economically important fruit fly species in the world because of the very wide range of fruit and vegetable hosts it infests, including citrus. In Mediterranean countries, this species can significantly limit citrus production, and in some cases, only early varieties can be grown because late-season varieties become too infested and thus unmarketable. Luckily, this species has not become established in the continental United States, and previous eradication efforts in Florida, California and Texas have been successful. Finally, the Mexican fruit fly ( Anastrepha ludens ) is another pest that requires attention. Generally similar to the other two species described above, it could be a particular threat to citrus if it becomes established in Florida, because grapefruit is one of its preferred hosts. Fortunately, detection of this species in Florida has been extremely rare and this species has not established in

the state. Eradication of Mexican fruit fly was successful in Texas, and the fly is thought to be currently eradicated in the continental United States. ## IDENTIFICATION

Adult fruit flies are small, yellowishbrown flies. The Caribfly is typically slightly larger than the common house fly, while both the Medfly and the Mexican fruit fly are generally smaller than a housefly. Each species has distinct markings on their wings, which are quite different than the generally translucent wings of a common housefly. When looking at adult fruit flies from the rear, the wing coloration appears to look like the legs of a spider. This spider 'look-alike' mimicry is thought to be a defense mechanism to scare away potential predators. The immature stages are typical maggot-like insect larvae (Fig.
