Most importantly, identify infestations early through regular monitoring. 11. Avoid broad spectrum, highly residual chemicals that will cause high mortality of naturalised parasitoids and predators (see section on biological control below). ## APHIDS AS VIRUS VECTORS

Aphids are the most common group of insect vectors of plant viruses. The largest group of plant viruses (Potyviruses) are all vectored by aphids. Some species of aphids may only vector a small number of viruses, whereas green peach aphid can vector over 100 plant viruses and is considered by many to be the most efficient vector of plant viruses across all insect species. Cucumber mosaic virus , Celery mosaic virus , Potato leaf roll virus , Potato virus Y , Beet western yellows virus (and other beet yellow viruses), Papaya ringspot virus , Watermelon mosaic virus , Lettuce mosaic virus and many other viruses affecting vegetable and ornamental crops are all vectored by aphids. The host range of each virus varies but often includes ornamental species and weeds. If you are experiencing virus infection it is well worth having aphids and the virus identified to gain further information on virus and vector biology and host range. This will aid in management of both pest and disease. For more information read the viruses in production nurseries fact sheet and the aphid transmitted viruses fact sheet. ## ADDITIONAL AND IMPORTANT STEPS TO MANAGE APHID TRANSMITTED VIRUSES

12. Do not supply plants to clients that are infected with viruses; they cannot be cured. 13. Dispose of virus infected plants promptly, ensuring that aphids will not migrate from the plants to other parts of your property. If necessary, apply an insecticide or oil spray to kill aphids before destroying the crops. 14.
