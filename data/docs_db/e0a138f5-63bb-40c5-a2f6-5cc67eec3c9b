## BACKGROUND

Aphids are relatively small, bulbous, soft-bodied insects that are common pests in production nurseries across Australia. There are about 5000 described species of aphids worldwide but only about a few hundred are known to be present in Australia. Of these, only a small fraction are believed to be native to Australia (only a few dozen); the rest were accidentally introduced with many species probably incidentally transported to Australia on cultivated plants by early British settlers. This pest management plan compliments and builds upon the general aphid fact sheet. A detailed fact sheet specifically on green peach aphid is also available. ## GENERAL BIOLOGY

The biology of aphids is quite complex and lends itself to rapid multiplication and dispersal. Most species are all female, do not need to mate and rarely lay eggs. Instead first instar nymphs are born, which begin feeding almost immediately. Each individual moults through a number of immature stages and eventually becomes an adult (female) that can then begin bearing young. Some species will produce males just prior to winter in cooler climates. In this case, adults mate and females lay eggs. Eggs do not hatch until temperatures increase in spring. Green peach aphid, GPA, Myzus persicae , is one such species that has this type of biology (refer to the fact sheet on this species for more detail). In warmer climates, and in glasshouses that are artificially heated, this does not occur; the populations may reproduce asexually for the entire year.

Immature insects never have wings, only adults have wings. For most insects, the adults of each species either have wings, or do not. However, adult aphids sometimes have wings and sometimes do not. Wingless adults reproduce more quickly, but have limited dispersal ability. Winged adults reproduce generally at about half the rate of

wingless adults, but have great dispersal ability on wind currents. Most individuals become wingless adults. Winged adults are more likely to occur when the density of aphids becomes high or when the plant health of their host begins to decline. Most species of aphids are highly host specific, having hosts from one or a small number of closely related genera. Only a small number of aphid species are highly polyphagous, feeding on a large number of host plant species from many plant families. Of course, these species are the ones most commonly encountered in production nurseries, giving the illusion that aphids feed on a large number of host plant species. Most aphids are small, their bodies being no more than 1-2mm long, but some species can be a massive 6-7mm long (e.g. Cinara spp.). Most species are oval or almond shaped are often light to dark green, yellow or orange, but some species are relatively dark, e.g. cow pea aphid is black. Winged individuals are often black.

Most often, aphids become pests during mild conditions, in spring and autumn in Australia. High summer temperatures tend to reduce populations drastically and low temperatures cause populations to reproduce slowly or go into diapause. However, exceptions will occur when considering the entirety of Australia's climatic conditions, particularly in protected cropping with good environmental control systems. During good conditions, aphids can complete their lifecycle in 5-10 days and females may lay 1-2 offspring per day. As such, populations can build up rapidly from even one aphid flying into a crop. ## SYMPTOMS

Aphids produce damage from direct feeding, from injecting salivary secretions into the plant and from the production of black sooty mould. The exact damage depends upon where they are located on the plant. Many aphids are found on the underside of leaves, particularly new growth that has not fully expanded. Leaves that are fed upon by aphids as they expand may be deformed or stunted. Even small numbers of aphids growing on the growing tips can potentially cause abnormal, deformed and stunted growth that may cause the plant to be unsaleable. Aphids feeding on fully-expanded leaves may cause the leaves to become chlorotic, wilt and fall from the plant. In addition, large populations can cause much reduced plant growth rates. The saliva injected into the plant by aphids may cause similar symptoms (i.e. retarded or stunted new growth) and, when in large numbers, stem dieback. Aphids produce honeydew, which is sugary and often attracts ants. Some species of aphids may be attended by ants that may protect them from predators and parasitoids and may move individuals. Black sooty mould also grows on honeydew and can cause plants to become unsaleable. Large populations may cause plants to become covered or dusted in white casts (skins from moulting individuals). A small number of aphid species feed on roots. Such species appear similar to root feeding mealybugs and cause similar damage, i.e. reduced growth rates and plant vigour. Very heavy infestations may cause certain plants to wilt, collapse and die. In addition, there are a small number of aphids that produce galls (refer to the galling insect pest management plan). Many species may cause leaf curl or deformity of new growth. Deformed Abelia leaves caused by aphid feeding. picture_counter_7 no image summary

## MONITORING FOR APHIDS

In general, it is recommended to inspect plant health on a weekly basis and record data. Modify monitoring effort based on risk of all pests and diseases, allocating greater effort to crop lines that are susceptible and to high risk periods. For aphids, spring and autumn tend to be high risk periods. Frequent monitoring will enable infestations to be spotted while populations are still low, and thus easier and cheaper to manage. Aphids can be monitored by visual inspection and beating plants, and winged aphids can be detected on sticky traps. It is important to note that aphids may be more difficult to detect on pale yellow or green leaves, particularly at low densities. 1.
