The pest was first reported in Uganda in June 2016 at Kayunga,  Kasese  and  Bukedea  districts. By  end  of  2017,  the  pest  had  spread  to  all  the districts of Uganda. FAW is capable of feeding on more than 100 plant species with maize and sorghum  being  the  most  preferred  hosts. In  Uganda,  the  pest  has  been  confirmed  to  be feeding  on  maize,  sorghum,  sugarcane,  rice,  millet,  wild  sorghum,  cotton,  napier  grass, capsicum  and rhodes grass ( Chloris gayana ) by April 2018. FAW is migratory in nature and moths fly for over 100km per night. The pest can persist in an area  throughout  the  year  where  there  is  availability  of  alternative  hosts  and  favorable temperatures such as in Uganda. ## Garden preparations

<!-- page_break -->

## Prepare your garden 1 - 2months before onset of rains

Deep plough your garden before planting. This will expose any FAW pupae to the surface of the soil, where they will be killed by the sun or attacked by other organisms such as insects, birds, etc

## Planting

-  Plant your maize early at the start of the rains, to escape the peak migration of FAW adults to your garden. -  Boost the crop growth vigour by using optimum fertilizer application or manure so that your maize plant can withstand pest infestations and damage. ## Community Action

Community action is required to control FAW. Scout for fall armyworm together, as a village. Farmers in the same community are encouraged to plant at the same time where possible. If you find FAW on your garden, alert your neighbours and take action. ## Management during growth

## A) Monitoring

Monitoring is the deliberate effort of checking for the presence of Fall armyworm on maize growing in your garden. It is important to monitor your maize crop frequently after germination for presence of the pest and or signs/damage symptoms. Early detection of the pest allows quick and timely response which will help minimise damages to your maize crop and reduce harvest  losses. The  Fall  Armyworm  caterpillar  attacks  all  stages  of  maize  growth  i.e. seedling, vegetative, tasseling and  grain filling stages.
