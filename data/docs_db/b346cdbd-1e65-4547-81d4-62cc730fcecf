In potatoes, even though the direct injury due to European corn borer is often very minor, the injury sites can act as a port of entry for disease organisms, such as Pectobacterium spp. stem rot and blackleg. ## Field Scouting for Egg Masses, Larvae and Injury to Crops

Field scouting should begin in early July. Fields should be prioritized by planting date and relative maturity. Older fields should be scouted first. For any of the host crops, assess a minimum of 10 plants, 3 plants in 3 areas, plus one additional plant in one of these areas. These three areas should be about equal distance apart, relative to the size of the field, and a minimum of 20 m apart. Avoid assessing plants within 10 m of the field 's edge. Look for egg masses, young larvae and injury to the plant. - Turn over leaves, looking for egg masses on the underside of the leaves. In corn, females are attracted to the silks and deposit egg masses predominately on leaves near the ear. If ears are present in corn, concentrate scouting on the three leaves above and below the ear zone. - Look for larvae and injury on the plants. In corn, the larvae are most commonly found in the midrib and leaf axil. Look for any holes or tunneling along the mid-rib of the leaves, or on the stem/stalk where the leaf axil connects. Frass on the stem is a good indicator of larval tunneling. Pull open the whorl of corn to check for larvae feeding within the whorl. - If there is evidence of frass or tunneling into the stem/stalk, plants can be slices lengthwise from tip to base with a sharp knife to look for the older larvae . If the majority of larvae have bored into the stalk, do not apply insecticides as they are ineffective once the larvae have entered the stalk. If no larvae or egg masses are found, repeat scouting every five to seven days. Continue scouting until larvae start to tunnel into the stalk, or the end of July if no egg masses / larvae are found. To monitor for European corn borer nationwide and in multiple host crops, the Insect Surveillance Working Group of the Canadian Plant Health Council developed the protocol outlined above. Those assessing European corn borer levels in corn, potatoes, quinoa, hemp, millet or any other host crop are encouraged to submit your data or observations using a free Survey123 app (available for both desktop and mobile devices):

Early to Mid-Season European corn borer monitoring (Before July) -https://arcg.is/0qCCHH

Later Season European corn borer monitoring (July to Pre-Harvest) -https://arcg.is/fSODf

To use, download the Survey123 app; you can click on 'Continue without logging in', once on the login screen. Data will be used to answer questions about the preferred host crops of European corn borer in Canada, its distribution, and relative abundance across Canada. ## Thresholds

Grain corn - the average grain weight reduction when stalk feeding was initiated during the 10-leaf, 16-leaf, blister and dough stages were 5.94, 5.01, 3.13, and 2.41 percent per larvae per plant, respectively. If larvae were found in the whorls of the plants, the following Management Worksheet can be used to determine whether a foliar insecticide application would be economical and to what extent:

## Management Worksheet for European Corn Borer

- [ ] \_\_\_\_\_ % of 100 plants infested x \_\_\_\_\_ average # borers/infested plant = \_\_\_\_\_ Borers/Plant

- [ ] \_\_\_\_\_ borers/plant x 5% yield loss/borer = \_\_\_\_\_ % Yield Loss

- [ ] \_\_\_\_\_ % yield loss x \_\_\_\_\_ expected yield (Bu/A) = \_\_\_\_\_ Bu/A Loss

\_\_\_\_\_ Bu/acre loss x \_\_\_\_\_ price/Bu = $\_\_\_\_\_ Loss/A

- [ ] $\_\_\_\_\_ loss/A x \_\_\_\_\_ % control = $\_\_\_\_\_ Preventable Loss/A

- [ ] $\_\_\_\_\_ preventable loss/acre - $\_\_\_\_\_ cost of control/A = $\_\_\_\_\_ Gain (+ or -)/Acre if treatment applied

Silage corn - The threshold can range from about 10% of plants infested to about 40% of plants infested, depending on control costs and silage value. Sweet corn -For fresh market sweet corn, through early silk stage, treat if 5% of the plants have egg masses, larvae, or leaf-feeding damage.
