When a honeybee stings, its stinger (Figure A) is imbedded in the skin or clothing (figures B, C). The venom sack, which is also lost, pumps the remaining venom into the wound. It is important to note that, because the venom sack remains attached to the stinger in the wound, the stinger should never be pulled out. It should be scraped out so the remaining venom in the sac is not forced into the wound. The stinger of wasps and other bees is not barbed, so it doesn't remain in the wound or clothing. picture_counter_4 no image summary
