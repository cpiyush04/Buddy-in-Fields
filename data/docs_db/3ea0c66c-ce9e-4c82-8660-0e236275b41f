There are five larval instars of the corn borer. The first two instars (Figure 3) are whitish with black heads. After hatching, larvae will migrate to the whorl to feed. The first two instars feed within the whorl and cause shothole and

windowpane damage. The first two instars complete development in seven to ten days. The third instar larvae bores into the stalk or stem of their host plant. Once inside the stem, it is too late to achieve effective chemical control. In corn, the later instars (third to fifth) feed within the stalk and ear shanks, disrupting the normal movement of nutrients, which results in decreased yield. Tunneling and boring may permit secondary infection and damage by rotting of the stalk and ear. Older larvae (Figure 4) are flesh coloured with black spots and may also feed on silks, kernels and cobs. Once they are finished feeding, the mature larvae overwinter in corn stalks, cobs and plant debris on the soil surface. Figure 3. Early instar

## Pupae

In the spring, mature larvae turn into pupae to complete the life cycle (Figure 5). ## Damage

The European corn borer causes damage in several ways. In corn, the first sign of damage is the pinhole damage. If the larvae establish within a plant, it may cause several types of damage. The most severe damage is stalk breakage prior to harvest (Figure 7). Another type of damage is ear drop where cobs fall to the ground. The final type of damage may be the least obvious but can cause significant yield loss. By restricting nutrient flow in the plant, yield is affected by the production of smaller cobs (Figure 8). picture_counter_5 no image summary
