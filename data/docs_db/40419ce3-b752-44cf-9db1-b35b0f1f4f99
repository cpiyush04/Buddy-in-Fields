2016). Larvae begin feeding on the silks and move down the silk channel, where feeding generally occurs on the ear tip before larvae move into the ear (Wiseman et al. 1978). Complete development of H. zea can occur with only silk and tip feeding, with limited or no injury to  kernels,  as  the  tip  of  corn  ears  generally  contains  unpollinated kernels  that  do  not  develop. Because  injury  is  typically  limited  to the tip of the ear, H. zea is  generally  not  considered an economic pest when corn is planted within recommended planting windows (Reay-Jones and Reisig 2014). Although there is one report of H. zea causing average yield losses from 1.5 to 16.7% in the United States (Widstrom et al. 1989), this publication does not report data that support  this  statement  or  how  such  experiments  were  conducted. When kernel  injury  does  occur,  intraear  compensation  can  sometimes further reduce any impact on yield (Steckel and Stewart 2015). Despite  applications  of  insecticide  every  1-2  d  (Bibb  et  al. 2018) or every 3-4 d (Reay-Jones and Reisig 2014) from R1 for H. zea control, yields were not affected by insecticide treatment compared to the untreated control. While H. zea is a major economic pest of sweet corn (Olmstead et al. 2016) though primarily because for aesthetic reasons rather than yield loss, H. zea injury generally does not lead to yield loss in field corn, including when comparing hybrids expressing insecticidal Cry proteins from Bt to non-Bt near isolines (Buntin et al. 2004, Bowen et al.
