## Scouting and Economic Thresholds

In 2005, 42,000 acres of corn were harvested in Utah. This relatively small amount makes western corn rootworm populations highly variable from field to field. Therefore, monitoring should be done annually in every corn field. Although adults are skittish and drop from plants, they are the preferred stage to sample. Larvae are less practical to sample because they are in and around the roots and so destructive sampling is required to estimate density. Weekly scouting of adults in July and August will help predict larval damage the next year. Whole plant counts: The most widespread method for sampling adults is whole-plant counts. Try to sample the entire field in a 'W' or 'V' pattern to ensure coverage. Visit at least 27 locations and sample two plants per location. Count the number of beetles per plant. Start by holding the ear tip closed to prevent adults from dropping out. With your free hand, examine all the leaves, paying particular attention to the leaves closest to the ear. Then slowly open your hand and watch for adults to drop as you strip the husk away from the ear tip. After sampling, calculate the average number of corn rootworm beetles per plant. If the average number is ≥1, adults have reached the treatment threshold, and larvae could cause significant lodging (Fig. 6) and/or yield loss the following season. Sticky card traps: Sampling whole plants for adult corn rootworm is the most accurate way to predict larval damage the following year. But sticky cards can

help monitor for initial and peak adult emergence during silking and pollen shed. Use one sticky card for every 5 acres of corn. Place the sticky card near the ear tip and check once a week. Consider treatment the following year in continuous-corn if adults exceed 35 per trap per week. ## Control Options

For fields that have experienced yield loss due to western corn rootworm, there are several cultural and chemical options available. Only treating when adults exceed thresholds will keep production costs down and minimize genetic resistance to insecticides. Crop rotation: Often western corn rootworm can be controlled with crop rotation. Rotating corn with other crops every 3 years minimizes survival and subsequent root damage. Since the 980's, some western corn rootworm populations go through an extended diapause. Normally, eggs hatch after one winter, but some eggs are not hatching until after two or more winters. Extended diapause increases the likelihood of larvae hatching into rotational corn, and again synchronizes the insect with corn production. This new adaptation has not been observed in Utah. Early planting: Corn becomes less attractive to adults after pollen shed. Planting early may help disrupt the timing of adult emergence with corn silking. Early-planted fields also have stronger root systems that may tolerate feeding larvae. Soil treatments: Using granular insecticides at the time of planting can effectively reduce corn rootworms. In-furrow or banded applications work best if followed by cultivation and irrigation. Products like bifenthrin 2EC AG® and chlorpyrifos 4E AG® can be incorporated into the soil for corn rootworm control. Transgenics: This advanced technology should be utilized for continuous-corn production with consistent corn rootworm pressure. Products like YieldGard®Rootworm and Herculex®RW have a toxin ( Bacillus thuringiensis, Bt ) inserted into the genetic makeup of the corn seed. Corn rootworms ingest a fatal dose of Bt toxin while feeding and never develop into adults. This technology is expensive and should be used in conjunction with an active adult scouting program. Deciding when and where to plant Bt -corn should be made after adults exceed treatment thresholds in a given area. Seed treatments: Corn seeds treated with an insecticide, like Cruiser 5FS®, can help reduce light to moderate corn rootworm feeding pressure, but may not be effective under heavy pressure. Adult treatments: Using insecticides for adults is generally not recommended unless severe silk clipping occurs. Remember adult insecticides can pose a serious threat to honey bees during pollen shed. <!-- page_break -->

## Other Leaf Beetles Related to Western Corn Rootworm

Western corn rootworm is closely related to other leaf beetles in the family Chrysomelidae (Figs. 7-2). Other leaf beetles can look similar to western corn rootworm with slight color variation on the wings and head (Figs. 0-2). In some parts of the United States, three rootworm species (i.e., northern, western and southern) can be feeding in corn at one time. In Utah, the western corn rootworm is the most economically important species. When distinguishing western corn rootworm from other leaf beetles, notice the three black stripes on the forewing do not always extend to tips and can sometimes 'bleed' together (Figs. 2, 8).
