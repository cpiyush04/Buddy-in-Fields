| T. novocaledonensis            | None                             | Adults have been taken from various herbs, shrubs and trees including rose, mango, avocado, Dodonaea, hibiscus, ageratum and other plants. It is only reported from Norfolk Island, not mainland Australia or Tasmania. |
| T. palmi                       | Melon thrips                     | Many species, particularly from Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae and other families and orchids. It is only known from around Darwin, north Qld and southeast Qld - quarantine restrictions apply. |
| T. parvispinus                 | Taiwanese thrips                 | Tends to be highly polyphagous and often highly attracted to gardenia. It is recorded from Asteraceae, Apocynaceae and others in Australia. Widespread across northern Australia. No significant damage reported in Australia. |
| T. simplex                     | Gladiolus thrips                 | Feeds and damages Gladiolus flowers and is found wherever these plants are grown. Also feeds on other Iridaceae species. |
| T. tabaci                      | Onion thrips                     | Allium sp. are preferred hosts but it will feed on many other species including brassicas, tomatoes, beans, cucurbits, roses, potatoes and species from Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Crassulaceae, Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, Malvaceae, Mimosaceae, Moraceae, Myrtaceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae, Rutaceae, Solanaceae and many others. It is widespread across Australia. |

enable  infestations  to  be  spotted  while  they  are  still light, and thus easier and cheaper to manage. Methods of monitoring may include:

1. Visual  inspection  and  plant  beating can  be completed  simultaneously. Examine  young  leaves and new growth of plants that look stunted, chlorotic  or  have  silvering  on  both  leaf  surfaces using  a  10x  hand  lens. Thrips  tend  to  inhabit crevices  near  leaf  veins  and  growing  tips. Move through  the  crop  and  gently  but  firmly  hit  foliage against  a  beating  tray  (which  can  be  a  folder, bucket or plastic plate). The beating tray should be a  single  colour;  white,  grey  or  black  is  preferable as  this  will  make  moving  organisms  more  visible. Beating plants is a relatively efficient way of monitoring for insects and mites that can be knocked  from  plants,  including  thrips,  herbivorous and predatory mites, aphids, whiteflies, lady beetles,  small  caterpillars  and  a  variety  of  other insects. However, thrips may fly off the beating tray quickly,  so  beat  a  few  metres  worth of plants and then examine the tray. Once something is found, a 10x hand lens can be used to inspect the catch. 2. Yellow sticky traps are  useful  tools  for  monitoring thrips adults. Adults are most attracted to young foliage and flowers, so traps should be positioned just above the plant tops. Traps should also be placed near doors, vents and any susceptible crops or areas. At least one trap  per  100  m 2 is  recommended  for  greenhouse crops, more in varieties that are known to be susceptible  to thrips. Inspect  sticky traps  at least weekly and change traps every 2 to 4 weeks. Where thrips  have  been  associated  with  prevailing  winds  in spring, traps can be placed at the leading edge of the property  (i.e. upwind)  and  monitored  at  least  weekly during  high  risk  periods. This  may  assist  in  allotting monitoring effort in susceptible crops more efficiently. For  both  types  of  monitoring,  record  the  level  of infestation (low, medium, high) and extent of damage. Your  records  can  help  to  identify  areas and varieties that are more susceptible to infestations. It is also important to continue monitoring  following  application  of  insecticides  or release of biological controls to determine  the effectiveness  of  treatments. These  records  can assist  with  making  management  decisions  in  the future. Insect  monitoring data sheets are available in the BioSecure HACCP protocols available on the NGIA website (www.ngia.com.au). Simple and effective  spreadsheets  can  also  be  created  and modified to suit your  nursery. Remember  that damage to growing tips requires some time to grow out. Thus symptoms may still occur for some time after thrips have been eradicated, depending upon the growth rate of the plant. ## Management

Put in place as many cultural management practices as possible. These actions reduce pest pressure passively, reducing the number of thrips that occur in each crop. Fig.
