2). Adults will congregate on corn to mate and feed, but are easily disturbed and will drop from corn silks as you walk to a plant. Western corn rootworm eggs are white, football shaped and less than 1/32˝ long. Newly hatched larvae are nearly colorless, but gradually turn white as they feed and get older. Mature larvae reach about 1/2˝ long, and are creamy, white in color with a brown head capsule (Fig. 3). The pupae are translucent white and look similar to the adult stage. picture_counter_3 no image summary

## Western Corn Rootworm Life Cycle

Western corn rootworms have one generation per year (Table ). In late summer, mated females deposit small egg clutches near the base of corn stalks, where they remain unhatched for the winter. Females can lay between 500 and ,000 eggs during their lifetime. Eggs must go through a cold period, called diapause, before hatching in late spring. Newly hatched larvae move down into the soil and begin feeding on secondary corn roots. Larvae go through three instars and eventually start feeding on and in the primary corn roots. In July, larvae pupate in the soil, emerge as adults in 5 to 0 days, and begin feeding on corn silks. picture_counter_4 no image summary

## Damage Symptoms

As the name suggests, larvae are the damaging stage because they feed on corn roots. Larval feeding on corn roots can reduce yield by 0% or more. Larvae disrupt the plants' ability to take in water. Initially, injured root tips will be discolored or have brown lesions; over time, primary or secondary roots can be completely pruned (Fig. 5). Pruned roots cannot absorb water as effectively as healthy roots. Heavy larval infestations can cause extreme 'goosenecking' or lodging of corn stalks, making harvest difficult (Fig. 6). Damaged corn roots are also more likely to get root and stalk fungal diseases. Western corn rootworm females are strongly attracted to corn to lay eggs. Females prefer moist soil between the rows in irrigated corn or heavier soil with organic matter &gt;.5%. Although adults will feed on corn leaves and silks (Fig. 4), economic damage from adults is rare. More often adults will clip corn silks before pollination, which can result in poorly filled ears. picture_counter_5 no image summary
