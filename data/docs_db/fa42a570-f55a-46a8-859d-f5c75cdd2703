## Chemical Control:

1. Seed treatment: Cyantraniliprole 19.8% + Thiamethoxam 19.8% FS @ 6 ml/kg of seed will be effective for 15-20 days. 2. First Window (seedling to early whorl stage): To control FAW larvae at 5% damage  to  reduce hatchability of freshly laid  eggs,  spray  5%  NSKE  / Azadirachtin 1500ppm @ 5ml/l of water. 3. Second  window  (mid  whorl  to  late  whorl  stage): To  manage  2nd  and  3 rd instars larvae having more than 10% foliar damage the following chemicals may be used upto early tasselling stage: Spinetoram 11.7% SC or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC or Thiamethoxam 12.6% + Lambda cyhalothrin 9.5% ZC. 4. Poison baiting: Poison baiting is recommended for late instar larvae of second window. Keep the mixture of 10 kg rice bran + 2 kg jaggery with 2-3 litres of water for 24 hours to ferment. Add 100g Thiodicarb or ---------or------- just half an hour before application in the field. The bait should be applied into the whorl of the plants. 5. Third  Window (8  weeks  after  emergence  to  tasseling  and  post  tasseling): Insecticide  management  is  not  cost  effective  at  this  stage. Bio-pesticides  as recommended above to be applied. Hand picking of the larvae is advisable. All the sprays should be directed towards whorl and either in the early hours of the day or in the evening time. ## Capacity building and mass awareness

1. Application and timely plant protection measures to avoid spread of the insect from the abandoned crop. 2. Creation of awareness among important stake holders through trainings /group discussions. 3. Community  based  and  area-wide  approach  for  implementing  management strategies. <!-- page_break -->
