## Cabbage Looper

Trichoplusia ni (Hübner)

## Description:

Immature stages - Eggs are round and flat (0.6 mm wide by 0.4 mm high) with fine ridges from top to bottom. Larvae are light to dark green with a light longitudinal stripe on either side of the body and two pair of abdominal prolegs. The body is thick, tapers toward the head and the larvae crawl in a looping fashion, arching the middle portion of the body. Larvae may reach a length of 35 mm, which makes it one of the larger larvae found on vegetable crops. Adult stages - Forewings of the cabbage looper adult moth are grayish to dark brown with a silvery spot near the center; hindwings are pale brown. The wingspan is 33-38 mm. ## Biology:

Cabbage loopers can have up to seven generations in south Georgia each year. Reproduction occurs throughout the year but slows during winter, with lower development temperature threshold between 1012 o C.
