## Biological Control:

Inspect for beneficial natural enemies of cabbage looper including nuclear polyhedrosis virus that causes larvae to collapse, Trichogramma spp. parasitized eggs, and various wasp parasitoids. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis kurstacki has long been used for effective suppression of cabbage looper, and has the advantage of not disrupting populations of beneficial insects. ## Cultural Control:

Floating row covers, where economically practical, are effective at preventing cabbage looper moths from depositing eggs on crops. Alton 'Stormy' Sparks, David Riley, University of Georgia, 2021
