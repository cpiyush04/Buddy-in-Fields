eventually bore into the forming tassel. Infested tassels break when mature. As the larvae continue to grow, they eventually bore into stalks, usually at the internodes, and some find their way to the ears by boring through the side or the stem end of the ear. Heavily infested corn is easily lodged, making picking difficult. Some larvae move down the silk channel and attack ear tips. Mature larvae pupate in the cavities and some emerge as adult moths to start the second generation in August. ## Management

## IPM Strategies:

- Monitoring - European corn borer flights can be monitored using net traps baited with pheromone lures. In whorl stage corn, the degree of infestation can be monitored by scouting for 'shot holes' . Details of monitoring and management are found in Integrated Management of Sweet Corn Insects in New Hampshire (http:// extension.unh.edu/resources/files/Resource002124\_Rep3135.pdf), which is on UNH Cooperative Extension's website. - Cultural Practices - Spunbonded row covers used while the corn is young can exclude the moths and eliminate the need for spraying. Plowing under corn refuse in the fall and early spring will help keep this pest in check. Keeping fields free of weeds will also reduce the pressure of European corn borer. - Biological Control - There are a few natural enemies which prey on eggs and small larvae of European corn borer and can reduce the need for insecticide applications. In some situations, these ( Trichogramma wasps for example) can be purchased and released, but may not be economically feasible. Biological insecticides based on Bacillus thuringiensis can be very effective controls, especially when applied down the whorl. - Chemical Control - If pesticides are used, the two critical periods are (1) late whorl stage, when the tassels just become visible down inside the whorl and (2) fresh silk stage. In the late whorl stage, pesticides are aimed into the whorl, not elsewhere. During the fresh silk stage, pesticides are aimed at the silks. - Genetic Control -  Some genetically modified sweet corn varieties are available, that control European corn borer well. They may be most useful for fields located where spraying would be difficult. Genetically modified varieties are not allowed on organically certified farms. Consult the New England Vegetable Management Guide or your county Agricultural Field Specialist for specific pesticide recommendations. <!-- page_break -->
