2). ## DAMAGE

Adult female fruit flies will puncture fruit with an organ referred to as an 'ovipositor' with which they also lay eggs. Caribfly deposits a single egg per puncture hole, while the other two species may lay up to approximately 10 eggs per puncture. Caribfly will lay eggs into mature or over-ripe fruits. The egg-laying punctures appear like small shot holes, and larvae will crawl out of fruit through these same holes
