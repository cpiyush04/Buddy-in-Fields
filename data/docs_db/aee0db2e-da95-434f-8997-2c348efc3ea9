Examine the undersides of leaves for the yellow-orange egg clusters. ## Cultural Controls

Remove weeds in and around the vegetable garden to eliminate alternative food sources for Colorado potato beetle adults. Crop rotation to avoid planting solanaceous crops in succession and destroying plant debris may reduce future Colorado potato beetle populations. Substantial feeding damage can be avoided by selecting early-maturing potato cultivars or planting later in the growing season. Mulching around potato plants (Figure 10) helps decrease the population of adults by interfering with their ability to find plants and increasing the number of beneficial insects. picture_counter_4 no image summary

## Trap Plants

Plants that attract Colorado potato beetle adults (trap plants) or early-planted potatoes can be placed around the border of the vegetable garden to lure overwintering adults away from the main crop. Trap plants should be discarded when they are no longer effective in diverting attention away from the main crop (e.g., potato). ## Physical Removal and Damage

Hand removal of larvae and adults reduces Colorado potato beetle populations, thus minimizing plant damage. Larvae and adults should be placed in a container of soapy water. In addition, the clusters of yellow-orange eggs on leaf undersides can be physically removed and destroyed. ## Insecticides

Spray applications of insecticides will kill Colorado potato beetle larvae and adults. However, Colorado potato beetle can develop resistance to insecticides, which may occur faster when the same insecticide is applied repeatedly. Consequently, it is important to rotate insecticides with different modes of action to delay or mitigate resistance. Insecticides should be applied when adults and early-instar larvae are present and before fourth instars enter the soil to pupate. The first- and second-instar larvae are more susceptible to insecticides than the third- and fourth-instar larvae. Thorough coverage of the upper and lower surfaces of plant leaves is essential. Eggs on the underside of plant leaves and pupae in the soil are not susceptible to insecticide applications because they are not affected or escape exposure from spray residues. Read the product label to ensure that the insecticide is labeled for use against Colorado potato beetle. ## Beneficial Insects

A number of beneficial insects will attack Colorado potato beetle larvae and/or adults. These include green lacewings, ladybird beetles, predatory stink bugs, spined soldier beetles, and tachinid flies. However, beneficial insects may not be effective in regulating Colorado potato beetle larvae and adult populations below damaging levels. Figure 10.
