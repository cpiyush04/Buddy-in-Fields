## OTHER NATURALISED BENEFICIALS

There are many aphid predators and parasitoids that are not commercially available. This includes other ladybird beetles, hover fly larvae, various predatory bugs, native parasitoids and lacewing species. Such populations can be preserved if broad spectrum and highly residual pesticides are not applied to a crop, particularly early in the season. Monitoring for pest and beneficial populations is extremely important to ensure pest numbers do not build up to damaging levels and to avoid unnecessary chemical applications.

Before applying predators or parasitoids for the first time talk to the biological control agent producer (for aphid predators this is Biological Services or Bugs for Bugs). They can assist and make tailored recommendations to optimise releases to best manage the situation at hand. Some species are available in banker plants or release sleeves that may enhance establishment. <!-- page_break -->

## PESTICIDES

There are many pesticides registered for the control of aphids in non-food nursery crops (Table 3). These include broadspectrum, long residual products (e.g. organophosphate, neonicotinoid and synthetic pyrethroid products) and products that are specific to aphids (e.g. pirimicarb) or sucking insects. Oil products can also be very effective, particularly for smaller species. However, some species, e.g. rose aphid, are not managed effectively with oils. Products available include those with contact, translaminar (moving across the leaf surface but not between leaves) and systemic modes of action. If a portion of the lifecycle is concealed within leaf curls, galls or other protected areas it is recommended to use a translaminar or systemic product. Always monitor the crop before applying a pesticide to determine if there is a large population of predators or parasitoids present in the crop. Natural enemies can be present in production nurseries at high numbers precluding the need for a pesticide application, even when they have not been purposefully released. The biopesticide Beauveria bassiana strain PPRI 5339 is also registered for use against aphids. Spores of this fungus that come in contact with a suitable insect may germinate, penetrate the exoskeleton and eventually kill the aphid. It has been tested and shown to be effective against a number of beetles and even two-spotted mite. However, to our knowledge, data have not been published on its efficacy managing aphids. Given that it can cause mortality on a range of insect groups it seems reasonable to assume that it may have high non-target impacts on natural enemies. If using this product, monitor pest populations closely to ensure that the product is effective. Furthermore, do not apply fungicide products to the crop as this will kill the fungi, rendering it ineffective. ## RECOMMENDATIONS

Never solely rely on pesticides to manage any pest. Always put in place cultural management strategies to reduce pest pressure passively which will in turn reduce the number of pesticide applications required. This will reduce the risk of inducing pesticide resistance and management costs. For more detailed information on pesticide resistance management and insecticide mode of actions refer to the webinars devoted to these topics. Where a particular aphid is regularly encountered during particular seasons it is recommended to take early action. Give greater monitoring effort to high risk crops and consider release of a suitable predator. Green lacewing is a good choice because it feeds on a wide range of prey, which may assist in early establishment and aphid suppression. Aphidius parasitoids are also very effective as long as you choose the appropriate species to manage the aphid in question. Biological Services also offers a product containing a mix of Aphidius species to cover a wider range of aphids. If using biological control, make multiple releases early in the infestation and monitor regularly to ensure that aphid numbers decline. If aphid populations rise to a point where biological control is no longer feasible, pesticides can be used to lower or eradicate the population. Apply pesticides to hotspot areas whenever possible to conserve natural enemies that may be present in the rest of the nursery. Before applying a pesticide, consider the impact it may have on naturally occurring predators and parasitoids (Table 3) and whether you are likely to release predators in the future. If predators and parasitoids are to be conserved refer to the low risk products column in Table 2. Where the presence of predators and parasitoids is not considered important, a number of broad-spectrum and highly residual products may also be considered. Refer to the broad-spectrum, highly residual column in Table 2. ## Table 2

*   Products can cause high mortality to some natural enemies present in the crop, but have a very low residual period. Where multiple applications are required rotate between the products. Always observe the pesticide resistance strategy on the label, if present, then continue the rotation as required. It is recommended to wait 1-3 days after the pesticide application to release predators or parasitoids to reduce the impact of the application on predators and parasitoids. As mentioned above, even low risk products impact predator and parasitoid populations. <!-- page_break -->
