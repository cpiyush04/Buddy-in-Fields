Therefore, unless the species has been confirmed by a diagnostician you should treat your identification as preliminary. ## MANAGING APHIDS

The appropriate management technique will depend on a number of factors, such as the extent of the infestation, the presence of other pests and predators in the crop, presence of viruses, other host plants present at the property and environmental conditions. The exact management strategy therefore has to be tailored to each property. Adopt as many cultural practices as possible to decrease the likelihood of aphid infestations. If necessary, apply biological control agents or pesticides to reduce and eliminate aphid populations. ## CULTURAL CONTROL

The prevention of aphid infestations and their spread is very important for successful management, as large populations can build up quickly and are more difficult to control. It is extremely important to prevent and manage aphids successfully to reduce economic impacts caused by aphidvectored viruses. 1.
