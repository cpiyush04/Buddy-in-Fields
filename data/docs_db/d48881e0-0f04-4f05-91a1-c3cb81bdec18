Rajasthan :   Out of the 7 lakh  hectare cultivated area the incidence is reported in 59,000 hectare in the districts of Udaipur, Banswara, Dungarpur, Pratapgarh, Bhilwara, Chittorgarh and Rajasmand. Madhya  Pradesh :    It  is  expected  that  out  of  11.3  lakh  hectare  area  under  Maize  in  the kharif  2019,  about  85,000  hectare  area  is  presently  affected  with  FAW  in  5  districts    ie. Chhindwara, Baitul, Seoni, Harda and Khandwa

Uttar Pradesh : FAW is now reported from Kannauj district. - ii) In the states where the FAW was reported during previous season 2018, the  FAW is again reported from almost all five states during Kharif 2019 and are detailed here. Karnataka:

Out of 6.20 lakh ha cultivated area FAW is reported in 1.4 Lakh ha

Andhra Pradesh

: Out of 32000 ha cultivated area FAW is reported only in 137 ha

Tamil Nadu:

Out of 2700 ha cultivated area, FAW is reported only in 200 ha

Telangana:

Out of 2.5 lakh ha cultivated area, FAW is not yet reported

Maharashtra:

The FAW is reported in about 2000 ha in Nasik district

- iii) It  is  expected  that  FAW  may infest the Maize in Bihar in the coming days and  may also spread to many districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh. ## 2. Revision of Advisories:

The members reviewed the existing Package of Practices for FAW and agreed to include seed treatment  as  well  as  other  insecticides  as  recommended  by  Registration  Committee. It  was further, agreed to include the available bio-pesticides that are already registered by CIB&amp;RC for various  crops  for  management  of  Lepidoptera  pests,  including  Entomo-Pathogenic  Nematode (EPN). The members agreed to add more options of insecticide for preparation of Poison bait, in addition  to  Thiodicarb. The  advisory  was  finalized  at  the  spot  with  help  of  ICAR  and  it  was decided  to  upload  on  website  and  send  letters  from  Agriculture  Commissioner  to  all  states  for adoption. <!-- page_break -->

## 3. Monitoring Plan:

The members reviewed the action plans in place by various State Governments for management of FAW. Many states where FAW occurred during last year are better prepared for management for the Kharif 2019. As FAW is reported for the first time in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh which are major Maize growing states, it was agreed to give more priority and Central team must visit for effective monitoring and management of FAW. Further, FAW may likely to spread in Uttar Pradesh and may occur in Bihar, may be by August-September, it was decided to appropriately advise  State  Governments  of  Uttar  Pradesh  and  Bihar  for  proactive  measures  for  FAW management. Other  major  Maize  growing  states  such  as  Karnataka,  Telangana,  Maharashtra,  Gujarat,  Tamil Nadu  must  be  monitored  at  regular  interval  during  Kharif  2019  for  effective  management  of FAW. The Maize crop is at harvesting stage/harvested in most of the North Eastern states. The FAW has been effectively managed and there is not much impact on yield loss due to FAW in North Eastern states (Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Sikkim and Meghalaya). ## Following action points were suggested:

-  All necessary measures in advisory are required to be adopted by states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh where the invasion of FAW has occurred first time. -  Only CIBRC approved pesticides should be used for management of pest. -  Integrated pest management approach is required to be adopted. -  Advisory should be uploaded on the website and letters should be sent to all states. -  Monitoring teams should be constituted immediately for visit to different states. -  CIPMC,s needs to focus on awareness camps through farmers field schools. -  In order to manage the pest, states can utilize funds from NFSM under local initiatives head or through RKVY.
