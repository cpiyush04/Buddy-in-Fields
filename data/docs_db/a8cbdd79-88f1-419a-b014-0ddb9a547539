To determine whether the population in a given field has reached the economic threshold, it is important to scout the field. Caution : Honey bees will forage for pollen from corn, with peak foraging in the morning and early afternoon. If the corn is producing pollen and insecticides toxic to honey bees are to be used, insecticide application to corn should be timed to avoid this peak foraging activity of the honey bee. Insecticide recommendations for European corn borer in field corn, potatoes, quinoa and dry beans can be found in Manitoba Agriculture's Guide to Field Crop Protection.
