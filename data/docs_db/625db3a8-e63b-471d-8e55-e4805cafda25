The impact of the different species in their current area of distribution is variable depending on season and crop. This group of moths are highly polyphagous and damaging and as a result are one of the main pest groups that cause significant monetary losses to agriculture worldwide. Spodoptera litura can be a serious pest to both field and protected crops in both temperate and tropical Asia. In India S. litura is a well-known pest of field crops and can cause losses of up to 23% on tomato crops in monsoon season. Under the right conditions S. litura can also cause losses of up to 100% on sugar beet and potato crops. The fall armyworm ( S. frugiperda ) pose a more global threat to crops and as such has a higher economic impact. Originating in the Americas, S. frugiperda was first detected in Africa in December 2015. In the intervening six years it has spread right across Sub-Saharan Africa and into South East Asia and Australia. This rapid spread of S. frugiperda has also been followed by crop losses especially in maize and sorghum across its current distribution in Africa. It has been estimated that it has caused a reduction in annual maize production in Kenya of 33% resulting in a loss of one million tons of maize for Kenya alone. Scaling this up across other maize producing countries with similar climates to Kenya, total yield losses of between 4.1 and 17.7 million tons have been estimated. In Europe Spodoptera are known to be pests of field, ornamental and protected crops. In Europe, the impacts caused by Spodoptera were minimal until the 1930's when S. littoralis was first recorded attacking crops, it has occurred sporadically ever since. In countries such as Spain, France and Italy S. littoralis is particularly important and has been reported attacking a wide range of commercial and ornamental crops such as: artichoke, cabbages, banana (Canary Islands), celery, lucerne, mint, pepper, potatoes, tomato, and watercress. It is also a pest of ornamentals both in the field and those grown under protection, and it is known to attack lawn grass and turf so much so that the pitch of Real Betis football team in

Seville had to be re-sown in the first week of September 2013. Of the Spodoptera species, S. littoralis , is one of the more  commonly intercepted in the UK and Europe, for example on imported ornamental plants and fresh produce. In the UK in the 1960's, large numbers of outbreaks of S littoralis occurred in glasshouses linked to the beginning of the trade in importing Dendranthema cuttings for flower production. Further outbreaks occurred in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and were related to the imports of a wide range of pot plants. There have been occasional outbreaks of S. litura in UK glasshouses in the 21 st  century. Spodoptera littoralis , litura and frugiperda are still intercepted on imports to the UK. Spodoptera exigua while often intercepted is not a species that we take action on. As an occasional migrant this species reaches the UK mainland naturally, while caterpillars have been recorded, numbers do not reach pest levels and the larvae do not survive the winter in the UK. Spodoptera species still pose a real threat to ornamentals and crops in the UK and still have the potential to be a serious pest of glasshouse crops in northern Europe. ## Advisory Information

Suspected outbreaks of Spodoptera spp (other than S. exigua ) or any other non-native plant pest should be reported to the relevant authority:
