## MANAGE PEST POPULATIONS. CRWs are the most destructive and costly insect pests in corn - responsible for up to $2 billion in lost revenues each year.* Dow AgroSciences understands the issues growers like you are facing to manage CRWs and has traits and technologies to address the immediate and long-term challenges. Using traits with multiple modes of action, such as SmartStax ® , is the most effective way to control insects. Work with your Dow AgroSciences representative to determine if additional management practices are needed, such as seed treatments, chemigation and soil-applied insecticides. ## ROTATE CROPS. picture_counter_1 no image summary

- Rotating to another crop can reduce CRW populations by breaking the pest cycle. - Continuous corn increases CRW populations and pressure. - Don't use Bt -traited corn with the same single mode of action for more than two years in a row. ## CONTROL HOST PLANTS.
