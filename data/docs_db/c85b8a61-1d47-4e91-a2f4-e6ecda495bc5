## Western corn rootworm

## What You Should Know

- Western corn rootworm can be a serious economic pest in corn because larvae feed on corn roots, making plants unstable or severely reducing water uptake. - Scouting for western corn rootworm adults can help make treatment decisions for the following year, and is critical to keeping production costs down. - Crop rotation can reduce rootworm damage. W estern corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera , is one of the most devastating corn insect pests in the United States. In some years, corn rootworms can cause up to $ billion in yield loss and control costs. In Utah, western corn rootworm has been detected in at least 3 counties (Fig. ), but likely can be found throughout the state wherever corn is grown. Western corn rootworms are native to North America and were considered minor corn pests until continuous corn production was implemented in the Midwest about 50 years ago. Without a non-host crop rotation, corn rootworms are able to build to damaging levels and cause severe yield loss. Today, nearly all continuous corn is treated with soil insecticides. Fig. .

## Description

Western corn rootworm is part of a three species complex in the United States, including northern corn rootworm, D. barberi , and southern corn rootworm, D. undecimpunctata howardi (Figs. 7, 9). Some corn production regions in the United States can have all three species feeding at one time. Although it is possible to have northern corn rootworm in Utah, typically only western corn rootworm is of economic importance. Adults are about 1/4˝ long, and have yellow bodies with three black stripes on the forewings (Fig.
