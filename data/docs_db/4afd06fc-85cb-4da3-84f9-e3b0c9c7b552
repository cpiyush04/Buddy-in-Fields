2016). While the insect is not thought to overwinter at latitudes greater than 40° (Hardwick 1965), H. zea is also a common pest in northern regions of the United States as a result of yearly migration. The insect is also a common pest other field crops such as cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., soybean, Glycine max (L.)  Merr.,  sorghum, Sorghum  bicolor (L.),  and  many  vegetable crops. The insect is present in temperate and tropical regions of the Americas as well as Hawaii (Zimmerman and Fletcher 1956). As a polyphagous pest, H. zea has three common names approved by  the  Entomological  Society  of America  (corn  earworm,  tomato fruitworm, and bollworm), in addition to being known as sorghum headworm, soybean podworm, and vetchworm. Formerly thought to be part of one species with the Old World bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), the taxonomy was clarified by Hardwick (1965) with a description of the two distinct species. Noted as a pest of corn as early as 1905 in the United States (Quaintance and Brues 1905), the insect has since received considerable attention, particularly as a  pest  susceptible  to  transgenic  corn  hybrids  and  cotton  cultivars expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Berliner toxins. While a recent review was published on management in sweet corn (Olmstead et al. 2016), this article aims to provide an overview of H. zea as a pest in field corn. ## Life Cycle

The number of generations per year varies with latitude, with one to  two  generations  in  Ontario,  two  generations  in  Massachusetts and Oregon, two to three generations in Delaware, the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys of California, and Ohio, three generations in Illinois, up to four generations per year in North Carolina and northern  Texas,  five  generations  in  Alabama  and  Louisiana,  six generations along the Gulf Coast of Texas, and seven generations in  south Texas  (Quaintance  and  Brues  1905,  Brazzel  et  al. 1953, Neunzig 1969, Hoffmann et al. 1991, Coop et al. 1992). The life cycle of egg, larva, pupa, and adult can be completed in about 30 d (Butler 1976, Hardwick 1965). The insect overwinters as a pupa in the soil, though this occurs only in the southern United States, since H. zea is  not  thought  to  overwinter  at  latitudes  greater  than  40° (Hardwick 1965). After eclosion in the spring, moths can migrate throughout most of the United States and southern Canada. The  adult  moth  (Fig. 1)  is  highly  variable  in  color  and  wing markings. Wing expanse averaged 38.6 ± 2.9 mm in the Americas (Hardwick  1965),  with  males  being  more  variable  in  size  than

females  (Quaintance  and  Brues  1905). Males  are  paler  (light yellow to brown) in color than females (brown to pinkish-brown) (Quaintance and Brues 1905). Longevity ranges from 7.5 to 14.5 d for males and from 9.5 to 18 d for females. Moths can feed on nectar on a range of plants (Nuttycombe 1930). Laid singly, eggs are dome-shaped or spherical with a diameter of 0.60 ± 0.05 mm in diameter and 0.52 ± 0.04 mm in height, with a pale green color shortly after oviposition turning to a more pale yellow  color  over  time  (Hardwick  1965). The  egg  stage  can  vary from 80 to 90 h at 25°C (Hardwick 1965) and from 2 d in midsummer to 8 d in the spring (Quaintance and Brues 1905). In corn, eggs are laid mainly on silks (Ditman and Cory 1931), though oviposition can occur on the upper leaf surface and on the stalk, particularly if silks are not available (McColloch 1920). Larvae typically develop through six instars, though a range of five to eight instars has been noted (Quaintance and Brues 1905). With  the  general  appearance  of  a  typical  noctuid  (Fig. 2),  larval head plates are orange to light brown, and the body color can be more  variable,  ranging  from  green,  brown,  pink  to  yellow,  with four pairs of pale prolegs and darker thoracic legs. Development is completed in 13.2 d for five-stadia larvae and 16.3 d for six-stadia larvae (Hardwick 1965). Head capsule width ranges from 0.292 ± 0.017  mm  for  first  instars  to  3.10  ±  0.11  mm  for  the  last  instar (Hardwick 1965). Body length ranges across instars from 1.5 mm at hatching to 42.2 mm for a fully grown sixth instar (Quaintance and Brues 1905). Newly hatched larvae first feed on their eggshell (Quaintance and Brues 1905), followed by migration to the ear in corn along the silks where feeding continues. Up to half of a larva's growth can result  from  silk  feeding  alone  (Quaintance  and  Brues 1905),  though  ear  tip  feeding  often  occurs  earlier  during  larval growth. The  pupa  (Fig. 3)  is  also  similar  to  many  other  Noctuid  species, with a shiny red to dark brown body (14 to 23 mm in length) (Quaintance and Brues 1905). The pupal stage lasts 13.5 d for males and 12.6 d for females (Hardwick 1965). Fully grown larvae drop to the ground where they burrow to create a pupal cell, with an average depth of 46 mm (Quaintance and Brues 1905), although pupal depth is likely a function of soil type, moisture, and pupal size. The insect overwinters in the soil as diapausing pupae (Hardwick 1965). ## Host Plants and Seasonal Dynamics

As a polyphagous pest, H. zea larvae feed and reproduce on both cultivated and wild hosts, though wild hosts are considered to be of lesser importance in southeastern United States agroecosystems (Neunzig 1969). Feeding on both wild and cultivated hosts occurs primarily on the reproductive structures. Surveys showed common weed hosts to include toadflax, Nuttallanthus canadensis (L.) D. A. Sutton,  in  North  Carolina  (Neunzig  1963)  and  crimson  clover, Trifolium incarnatum L., and cutleaf geranium, Geranium dissectum L. in  Mississippi  (Stadelbacher  1981). Among  crop  hosts, H. zea can  feed  on  soybean,  peanuts, Arachis  hypogaea L.,  cotton,  okra, Abelmoschus  esculentus (L.),  sweet  potato, Ipomoea  batatas (L.), tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L.,  alfalfa, Medicago sativa L.,  tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum L., green beans, Phaseolus vulgaris L. sorghum, Sorghum  bicolor (L.)  Moench,  and  strawberries, Fragaria spp. (Neunzig 1969). For at least two initial generations following overwintering in the southern United States, H. zea feed on wild hosts and corn; corn is a preferred host, with oviposition occurring on the silks during June-July across the southern United States (Roltsch and Mayse 1984, Bradley 1993). After corn silks dry, H. zea prefer to oviposit in other plant hosts during their blooming stages (Hardwick

1965; Terry et al. 1987a, b; Jackson et al. 2008; Head et al. 2010), with large numbers emerging from corn that inundate the landscape across an extensive region (Gould et al. 2002, Jackson et al. 2008). One of the most comprehensive datasets on H. zea dynamics in the southern United States is summarized in Jackson et al. (2008), which was a 2-yr study across five southern states examining H. zea larval infestations in several crops to determine the contribution of non-Bt and non-cotton hosts to a refuge for Bt cotton. The study showed that larval populations in corn, soybean, grain sorghum, and peanut were  substantially  greater  than  in  cotton,  with  populations  being mainly confined to corn in July followed by other non-cotton crops later in the year. Host usage by H. zea across four southern states has also been inferred by stable carbon isotope ratios and gossypol residues in moths (Head et al. 2010); the study showed that C 4 hosts were the main source of moths from mid-June to early September. Starting in August, C 3 hosts (cotton, soybean, and peanut) became a more dominant source of H. zea moths until mid-September when C4 hosts were again the overriding source. Gossypol analysis also showed that H. zea moths  from  cotton  represented  &lt;1%  of  total moths from June to early August, followed by a peak in September at 19%, indicating that cotton was a minor source of moths. These studies clearly show the major role that corn plays in the seasonal dynamics of H. zea , and the importance of non-Bt corn for Bt resistance management. In the northern United States, H. zea generally infests crops later in the season after migration from southern regions, and can be a serious pest of sweet corn (Bartels and Hutchison 1995), in addition to infesting field corn (Pilcher et al. 1997). ## Migration

The  widespread  pest  status  of H. zea is  greatly  aided  by  the  capability of moths to move both short and long distances (Fitt 1989). Movement of Heliothis and Helicoverpa moths has been hypothesized to belong to three categories (Farrow and Daly 1987), although the distinction  between the three can sometimes be unclear (Fitt 1989): 1) short-range movement within habitats close to plant hosts to meet appetitive needs, 2) long-range movement between habitats at heights of  1-10  m  to  meet  appetitive  needs,  and  3)  migratory  movement

downwind at heights greater than 30 m that are less associated with appetitive needs. Migration distances of at least 750 km from Texas to Arkansas were shown using pollen on H. zea (Hendrix et al. 1987). Citrus sp. pollen  was  collected  on H. zea in  Oklahoma,  suggesting migration from Florida, the Caribbean, Mexico, or Central America (Lingren et al. 1994). Moth migration from Mexico and south Texas to more northern parts of the United States is strongly supported by a lack of synchrony between traps catches of moths and emergence from overwintering (Stadelbacher and Pfrimmer 1972, Hartstack et al. 1982, Head et al.
