Introduction: The  tomato  hornworm, Manduca  quinquemaculata (Haworth),  is  the  most common insect pest of plants in the Solanaceae family which are also referred to as nightshade plants. Tomatoes appear to be the most preferred host but the insect also infests other nightshade plants  such  as  peppers,  eggplants,  and  potatoes. . The  tomato  hornworm  is  native  to  North America and is commonly seen in most tomato growing regions. Even though the hornworm is reported to be uncommon in the Southeastern region of the United States, reports of hornworm incidence and damage are common on tomato farms in Alabama during the first two weeks in June. Identification: Tomato hornworms are large pale green caterpillars which are about 3.5 to 4inches long, have 5 pairs of prolegs and a large projection or horn on the last abdominal segment; this  horn  is  the  reason  for  the  name  'hornworm.'  Tomato  hornworm  can  be  identified  by  the characteristic  V-shaped  yellow-white  markings  on  the  body  with  a  black  horn  on  the  last abdominal  segment. Adults  are  large  bodied  moths,  predominantly  grey  or  grey  brown  with lighter  markings. Moths  have  a  wing  span  of  4-5  inches,  with  remarkable  5  pairs  of  orange yellow spots on hairy robust abdomen. <!-- page_break -->

## Biology and Life history

In  early  summer,  adult  female  moths  lay  green  to  yellow-green  eggs  with  pearly  appearance; eggs are laid singly on the underside of tomato leaves. Eggs usually hatch in 6 to 7 days and the caterpillars develop through five stages of larval instars for 3-4 weeks until they pupate deep in the soil. Larvae pupate 3-4 weeks in the soil and adults can emerge in about 3weeks. Injury: In the southern parts of Alabama, hornworm damage usually starts within the first few weeks  after  transplanting  (i.e. in  mid-  summer  and  continues  throughout  the  growing  season. Damage to the tomato plants is caused by the caterpillars which feed on leaves and new stems. Caterpillars do less damage during the early stages when they;   feed on the upper portions of leaves. This caterpillar's green coloration is similar to the leaves and stems of tomato plants and this  allows  the  insect  to  camouflage  itself  by  lying  along  leaf  veins  or  stems. The  ability  to camouflage itself enables the hornworm caterpillar to go unnoticed until complete defoliation of the tomato host. Hornworms are aggressive feeders and one caterpillar can cause rapid damage to  the  plant  in  the  form  of  severe  defoliation. Caterpillars  cause  damage  on  the  outside  of  the tomato fruit, and leave large, open scars on the fruit as they feed. Caterpillars are also known to feed on green developing tomato fruits resulting in poor maturity and unmarketable fruits. Most of  the  hornworm's  leaf  consumption  occurs  during  the  last  week  of  feeding  of  the  late  instar which results in the destruction of most of the leaves and fruits. Management: Tomato  hornworms  are  easy  to  manage  through  regular  scouting  and  visual examination of plants for the presence of caterpillars, defoliation and fruit damage at least 2-3 times per week during summer. Tomato hornworms are fairly large in size and blend within the leaves and might not be noticed until the damage is done. The presence of hornworm droppings is  indicative  of  the  incidence  of  this  pest. Fresh  hornworm  droppings  show  areas  of  current hornworm activity and can provide information on sections of the farm that need to be treated. On small tomato farms, handpicking and dropping of hornworms in a bucket of soapy water is one  of  the  quickest  and  most  effective  management  methods. Cultural  control  methods  for tomato hornworm include crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops (i.e. crops outside the night shade family), management of weed hosts in the night shade family and promotion of natural enemy  populations. Trellising  of  tomatoes  (especially  indeterminate/vining  varieties)  helps  to allow the free flow of air and makes pesticide applications easier. It is easier to achieve better pesticide  coverage  of  tomatoes  that  are  trellised  relative  to  those  that  are  not  trellised. Many beneficial  predatory  insects  like  ladybird  beetles  and  green  lacewings  prey  on  the  hornworm eggs and young caterpillars. Tomato hornworms are also parasitized by wasps, which appear as white cocoon-like projections from the hornworms body. When such projections are observed growers should leave the infested hornworms on the tomato farm so that the adult wasps have ample  time  to  develop,  emerge  from  cocoons  and  parasitize  other  hornworms. The  economic threshold for hornworms is one or more healthy larvae per ten plants,   however, if all the above management  tactics  are  not  effective,  use  of  Organic  Materials  Review  Institute  (OMRI)approved insecticides is recommended. Spinosad, Pyrethrin and Azadirachtin (i.e. neem extract) are  recommended  for  the  management  of  hornworms  in  the  production  of  organic  tomatoes. These products are most effective when aimed at newly hatched or younger larvae; they perform poorly  against  larger/older  caterpillars. Growers  should  consider  spot  treating  the  infested sections of tomato fields where hornworm damage is observed as it is unusual for an entire field to  become  infested. Microbial  pesticides  such  as Bacillus  thuringiensis (Bt)  products  are effective  against  small/young  caterpillars  but  not  against  large/older  caterpillars. Effective monitoring and early detection are therefore critical to early application of these pesticides. It is generally recommended that pyrethrins are sprayed either early morning or late in the evening to avoid  targeting  natural  predators  and  pollinator  populations. Spraying  in  the  evening  or  late afternoons  is  actually  preferred  pyrethrum  breaks  down  into  less  effective  products  in  the presence of sunlight. Spraying in the evening or late afternoon reduces exposure to sunlight and allows  the  product  to  remain  effective  overnight. Bio  pesticide  rotations  are  recommended  to prevent  the  development  of  insecticide  resistance  by  tomato  hornworms. Certified  organic tomato producers must use OMRI-listed insecticides or check with their certifying organizations prior to using organic insecticides that are not OMRI-listed.
