Today, occasionally we find a tomato greenhouse where the soil did not freeze over winter, and the insects were not well controlled. That combination occasionally produces New Hampshire adults in June. But that does not change the general pattern that we rarely find eggs before July. Larvae of both hornworms are heavily parasitized by Apanteles wasps, but the parasites are very slow to kill the caterpillars. The tiny wasps locate a caterpillar and lay eggs inside its body. The eggs hatch into tiny maggot-like larvae that live inside the caterpillar. At first they feed on non-vital parts, like the caterpillar's fat reserves.
