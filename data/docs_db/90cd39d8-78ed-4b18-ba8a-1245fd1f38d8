Identify infestations early through regular monitoring (see section above). 2. Manage sources of  infestation:  control  broadleaf weeds and reduce other alternative hosts (identified through monitoring) in the production  area  and  surrounds. The  use  of weed matting, plastic or gravel on the floor can help in production nurseries. Good weed management will also help reduce a variety of other pest problems including aphids, whiteflies  and  mealybugs,  quite  apart  from other growing considerations. 3. Check  incoming  stock,  new  seedlings  and other  new  planting  material  to  ensure  it  is clean and to break the lifecycle of pest thrips. Never  propagate  from  mother  stock  that  is infested with pests. 4. Prune  and  thin  plants  with  light  to  moderate infestations to reduce pest load, increase airflow and access by insecticides. 5.
