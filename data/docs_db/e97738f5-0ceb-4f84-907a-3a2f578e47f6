Be aware of winged and non-winged aphids; as the number of winged aphids increases so too does the risk of spread to other areas of the property. 6. Check incoming stock, new seedlings and other new planting material to ensure it is clean and to break the lifecycle of aphids and other pests. The guidelines for managing biosecurity in nursery production (BioSecure HACCP) has more information on inspecting incoming stock. A self-imposed quarantine area, where plants are kept apart from the rest of your stock, is a valuable strategy to reduce pest and disease infestations. The length of time the plants are kept separate will depend on a variety of factors including temperature, plant species, the biology of pests and diseases encountered on the plants, space available and the size and purpose of the plants. Returning stock that has arrived from a supplier infested with a pest or disease may be a valid action.
