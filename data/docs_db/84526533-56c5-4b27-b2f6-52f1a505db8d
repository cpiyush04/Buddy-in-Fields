## 8. Is every pesticide effective against FAW? No. There is a list of recommended pesticides for controlling FAW, which have been proven to be  effective. They  include:  Rocket,  Super  Profenos,  Profecron,  Hitcell,  Dudu  Fenos,  AgroCypro, Striker and Engeo among others. ## 9. Is it recommended to mix different pesticides in the same knapsack spray pump when spraying FAW? No. It is advisable to use the recommended pesticides dosage because they are made for such specific pests use. Please use the recommended pesticides and dosage. <!-- page_break -->

## 10. Is it recommended to mix pesticides with foliar fertilisers in the same knapsack spray pump when spraying FAW

No. It is advisable to use the recommended pesticides dosage because they are made for such specific pests use. Please use the recommended pesticides and dosage. ## 11. Why are some pesticides not effective against FAW? There are several reasons why pesticides may not be effective for instance;

- a) Use of adulterated or expired pesticides
- b) Applying pesticides at the wrong time of day,
- c) Using non-recommended pesticides,
- d) Not following recommended application guidelines,
- e) The pesticides may have developed resistance

## 12. Are there any local innovations that can control FAW? Traditionally substance like ash, sand, tephrosia among others were used to control pest, but research is still testing if these are also effective with FAW

## 13. Is coordinated group spraying necessary? Yes. It helps area wide management of the FAW. If you spray and your neighbour does not, the pest can still migrate to your garden

## 14. Is FAW affected maize safe for consumption? FAW mostly eats the leaves of maize. Occasionally it  will infest ears/cobs  as  well. Usually, such ears are not consumed by humans. While direct damage from FAW doesn't affect the food  safety  of  the  maize,  it  could  make  the  maize  more  susceptible  to  aflatoxin  and  other fungal diseases such as smut

## 15. Is spraying in advance an effective way of controlling FAW? No,  it  is  not  cost  effective  and  the  recommended  pesticide  will  only  work  when  the  pest  is present. Note:

Its advisable to always consult with your agricultural extension officers. <!-- page_break -->
