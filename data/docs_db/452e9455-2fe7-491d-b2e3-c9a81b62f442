## 1. Introduction

Thrips  parvispinus (Karny)  is  a  cosmopolitan  pest  species  and  has been  reported  from  Thailand,  Australia  and  Europe. The  last  two decades witnessed a drastic extension in the geographic distribution of T. parvispinus and it is now known to occur in France, Greece, Hawaii, Mauritius,  Reunion,  Spain,  Tanzania  and  the  Netherlands,  besides India. It  is  a  polyphagous  species  and  has  been  reported  infesting beans, eggplant, papaya, chilli, pepper, potato, shallot and strawberry. In addition, it inflicts injury to ornamentals, viz. Anthurium, Chrysanthemum, Dahlia, Dipladenia, Gardenia and Ficus . In India, this species  was  first  reported  on  Papaya  from  Bengaluru  in  2015  and considering  its  potential  to  acquire  pest  status,  regular  monitoring  of this pest was carried in other parts of India after its first record. Infestation  of  this  invasive  pest  was  reported  in  chilli  growing areas of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka and caused significant damage  during  Rabi  season  2021-22. Survey  was  conducted  by  the expert  team  constituted  by  DAC  &amp;  FW  comprising  of  experts  from DPPQ&amp;S, ICAR, SAU and State Department of Horticulture/Agriculture  of  the  concerned  states  for  assessment  of infestation of thrips in chilli growing areas. Based on the recommendations of  survey  team,    ad-hoc  management  strategies  for invasive South East Asian thrips ( Thrips parvispinus ) in chilli is given below. 2.

Scirtothrips  dorsalis larvae  and  adults  damage  crop  by  sucking  sap mainly  from  undersurface  of  the  leaves  and  developing  fruits  which causes  crinkling  and  upward  curling  and  drying  of  leaves,  flower dropping,  stunted  growth  and  scrapping  of  chilli  fruits  and  it  is  the major problem of un-irrigated field during dry weather condition. Thrips  parvispinus adults mainly colonize on flowers and underside of leaves  whereas  larvae  suck  sap  from  undersurface  of  the  leaves. Infestation causes heavy  flower  drop  and  thereby reducing fruit production. Its infestation increased during heavy rainfall of North East monsoon in contrast to other thrips species.

## 3. Management strategies for the standing crop

1. Regular monitoring of thrips infestation in chilli and on other host plants near the field. 2. Collection and destruction of severely infested plants and uprooting  weeds  ( Parthenium  hysterophorus,  Cleome  viscosa, Prosopis sp., Lantana  camara,  Calotropis sp., Tecoma sp. , Abutilon sp. and wild Solanum sp.) present in the vicinity of field bunds which act as off season and alternate host for thrips. The plant debris after uprooting, either be buried or burnt in order to avoid further spread of the pest population. 3. Nipping and destruction of infested top/apical shoots. 4. Erection of blue sticky traps @ 25-30 per acre for mass trapping in thrips infested fields. 5. Spraying  of  botanical  based  pesticides  like  Neem  Seed  Kernel Extract (NSKE) 5% or Neem oil 3% @ 2 ml/L, Pongamia oil @ 3 ml/L, Vitex negundo extract @ 50-80 ml/L, etc. or microbial

based  insecticides  like Beauveria  bassiana @  4.00  g  or  ml/L (spore  load  -  1x10 8 cfu/g  or  ml), Pseudomonas  fluorescence -NBAIRPFDWD @ 20g/L or Bacillus albus -  NBAIR-BATP @ 20 g/L uniformly covering whole plant. 6.
