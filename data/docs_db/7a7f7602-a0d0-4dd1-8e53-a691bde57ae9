It is best to avoid overhead irrigation. - Do not work in infected orchards when the foliage is wet from dew or rain. - Windbreaks. Plant trees around blocks and/or between rows of large citrus plantations. A 10 m tall windbreak is effective for about 100 m. The distance between windbreaks depends on the susceptibility of the variety. ## RESISTANT VARIETIES

Grapefruit, Mexican lime and trifoliate orange are highly susceptible to canker. Sour orange, sweet orange, lemon and lime are moderately susceptible, and mandarin moderately resistant. Preference should be given to Valencia orange and mandarin. ## CHEMICAL CONTROL

Copper fungicides are effective in preventing fruit infection, but less so for leaf infection because leaves rapidly expand, exposing surfaces without copper protection. Apply two or three sprays 3 weeks apart, beginning when the fruits are about 5 mm diameter. The important time is 90 days after petal fall, when fruits are most susceptible. Note, soil accumulation may be of concern when using copper fungicides ( see Fact Sheet no.
