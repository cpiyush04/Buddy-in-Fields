More recent Bt traits in corn, known as 'pyramids', include events that express several toxins (Table 1), which can have the following advantages: 1) increasing the range of activity against multiple pests (Rule et al. 2014), 2) delaying the development of resistance by assuming that resistance to one toxin does not provide cross-resistance to other toxins included in the pyramid (Carrière et al. 2016), and 3) decreasing the size of the non-Bt refuge (Storer et al. 2012). The first Bt pyramid for above ground pests was commercialized in 2010 and expressed Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2; control of H. zea was  improved  compared  with  single-toxin  hybrids,  with  95%  control  in trials across four southern states in 2007-2009 (Siebert et al. 2012), 83% control in trials in South Carolina in 2007-2009 (Reay-Jones et al. 2009), and 97% control in trials in North and South Carolina in 2012-2013 (Reay-Jones and Reisig 2014). Bt hybrids expressing Cry1Ab + Cry1F do not provide better suppression of H. zea injury  than  either  toxin  alone,  with  55%  control  in  trials  in  North and South Carolina in 2012-2013 (Reay-Jones and Reisig 2014), and  46%  across  12  southern  states  in  2010-2011  (Reisig  et  al. 2015). Only the Vip3A20 toxin is rated as providing excellent levels of  control  of H. zea ,  and  is  considered  to  approach  a 'high  dose' (Burkness et al. 2010), i.e., a dose that kills &gt;95% of heterozygotes for single-allele Bt resistance (Gould 1998). Because Vip3A20 has no activity on stalk borers, Bt hybrids expressing this toxin are included in pyramids with either Cry1Ab, Cry1Ab + Cry1F, or Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2. Cry1Ab provide only limited suppression of H. zea injury  to  ears (Clements et al. 2003). The effect of Bt corn on aflatoxin contamination is inconsistent (Buntin et al. 2004, Bowen et al. 2014, Bibb et al. 2018), although most published studies examined single-toxin Bt hybrids and more data are needed on the potential role of pyramided Bt corn hybrids in reducing aflatoxin concentrations (Abbas et al. 2013). Insect injury to corn ears is only one of many factors that can impact the epidemiology of Aspergillus flavus ,  a common pathogen that produces aflatoxins (Diener et al. 1987). Suppression of aflatoxin therefore should not be considered a benefit of planting Bt corn in the southern United States. While beneficial impacts of Bt corn on yield are difficult to quantify when H. zea is  the  only pest, a widespread benefit of planting Bt corn has been the regional suppression of both O. nubilalis and H. zea , as demonstrated by 30 yr of trapping data in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States (Dively et al. 2018). ## Resistance to Bt Corn

In addition to H. zea , a number of insects are targeted by Bt corn, including O. nubilalis ,  fall  armyworm, Spodoptera  frugiperda (J. E. Smith), lesser cornstalk borer, Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Zeller), sugarcane  borer, Diatraea  saccharalis (F .),  western  bean  cutworm, Striacosta albicosta (Smith), and southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar. Yields  of  Bt  corn  hybrids  can  be  substantially higher than yields of non-Bt corn hybrids in the presence of corn borers  (Rice  and  Pilcher  2001). However,  infestations  of H. zea alone  in  Bt  corn  trials  only  rarely  result  in  significant  differences in yield between Bt and non-Bt hybrids (Buntin et al. 2004, Bowen et  al.
