Some species of sparrows and gulls may also feed on large numbers of larvae. Larvae in corn : Examine 20 plants in five areas of the field and determine the percentage of damaged plants. Also note the number of larvae found and their size. During the day, larvae may be found under plant residue on the soil, or in the whorl of the plant. Early symptoms in corn may include ragged feeding on the top leaves, and wet, brown pellets (feces) in the area. ## Economic Thresholds

## Threshold for Small Grains

Preheading : Treat when four or more armyworms per square foot are present. Heading (head clipping) : If heads are being clipped, treat when two or more armyworms per square foot are present. Avoid treating with insecticides when large numbers of parasitized larvae are present. Studies on wheat leaf consumption by armyworms showed that at the boot and anthesis stages wheat can sustain up to 75% defoliation by armyworms with little loss in yield, and even at population levels that resulted in 75% defoliation head cutting was negligible. Threshold for Corn : For corn past the 6-leaf stage, if 50% of the plants are showing damage and have larvae smaller than 2.5 cm (1 in.), insecticide treatment may be warranted. As long as the growing point of the plant is not damaged, the corn plant is usually able to recover from moderate feeding. With early-season feeding, insecticide may be warranted in seedling corn if there are two or more unparasitized larvae per seedling and feeding damage exceeds 10%. <!-- page_break -->

Threshold for Forages : Control is warranted when five or more larvae (smaller than 2.5 cm) per square foot are found. In seedling crops, two to three larvae (smaller than 2.5 cm) per square foot may warrant control. ## If counts of larvae above the threshold are found :

- Only infested areas of the field may need to be treated. Levels may vary between locations in a field, so assess how widespread the higher levels are. - Spraying should be done in the evening when armyworms are feeding on the plants. - There is little benefit in applying an insecticide once the majority of armyworms are nearly fully grown, pupae are present, parasitism is extensive, or the crop is nearing maturity. By that time most of the damage will have been done. ## Control Tips

## Biological Controls

Parasitoids : There are species of wasps and flies that can commonly parasitize armyworms. Pupal clusters from a parasitic wasp called Cotesia can sometimes be seen on plants in fields that have had armyworms (Figure 5). Cotesia larvae live inside the armyworms, and once mature, dozens of Cotesia larvae can emerge within minutes from a parasitized armyworm. Figure 6 shows an armyworm with the egg of a parasitic fly behind the head (note the white spot a little way behind the head). When scouting, check the backs of armyworms for parasite eggs. For some common parasitic flies the eggs are often laid just behind the head. Figure 5.
