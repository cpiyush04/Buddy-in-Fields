Annual migrations arise from southern areas in early spring. Eggs are laid singly on the underside of leaves. Larvae feed for two to three weeks and then pupate. High summer temperatures (40 o C or greater) can stifle reproduction and can be fatal at some stages of development. Cabbage loopers overwinter in the pupal stage. ## Damage:

The cabbage looper feeds on a wide variety of cultivated plants and is considered a secondary pest of tomato in Georgia. Cabbage looper readily feeds on crucifers such as broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Chinese cabbage, collards, kale, mustard, radish, rutabaga, turnip, and watercress. Other vegetable crops injured include beet, cantaloupe, celery, cucumber, lima bean, lettuce, parsnip, pea, pepper, potato, snap bean, spinach, squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. Additional hosts are flower crops such as chrysanthemum, hollyhock, snapdragon, and sweet pea, and field crops such as cotton and tobacco. Larval feeding on foliage is usually initiated on mature leaves and can occasionally occur on the surface of mature fruit. Older larvae consume large irregular areas of leaves, characteristically leaving the larger leaf veins. About 90% of total defoliation occurs during the last two larval instars. ## Management:

## Chemical Control:

Scout weekly to determine if a 5% defoliation threshold has been reached and, if so, treat with an effective insecticide spray.
