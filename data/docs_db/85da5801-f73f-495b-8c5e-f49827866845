D.O. No.12080/37/2018-PP.I

## Subject: Management of Fall Armyworm in maize. We are aware that Fall Armyworm caterpillar a native to North America landed in Africa in 2016 and in India and many other Asian Countries in 2018. Since then, it has wreaked havoc in ravaging crops, especially maize. In fact, FAO has already declared FAW as a food security threat. In a short span, in India its presence has been observed in ten states and Fall Armyworm infestation has spread from Karnataka to all southern states, then to western Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh Gujarat, Rajasthan and now to the few eastern Indian states also. DAC&amp;FW, situation of FAW is being monitored regularly by a High Powered Committee under the chairmanship of Secretary (DAC&amp;FW). Further different State Governments have also constituted state level committees comprising SAUs, KVKs, CIPMCs, State agriculture extension offices etc. Recently, a meeting was conducted under the Chairmanship of Agriculture Commissioner on 25 July, 2019 and management strategies were discussed and package of practices (POP) for FAW management has been revised with inclusion of few new interventions. Revised POP is enclosed for adoption by the states with the request to take all necessary measures to contain, suppress and eradicate the pest. Integrated Pest Management is the best approach to manage the pests where biocontrol agents have given excellent results in bringing the population of FA W down. I am enclosing here copy of revised package of practices and minutes for necessary action by the states.
