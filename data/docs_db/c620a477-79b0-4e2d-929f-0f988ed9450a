## BEE ALERT Africanized Honey Bee Facts

VINCENT LAZANEO, University of California Cooperative Extension Urban Horticulture and Pest Management Advisor, San Diego County

## BEE PREPARED

A fricanized honey bees (AHB)-also called 'killer bees'-became established in Texas in 1990 and are spreading to other southern states. AHB entered southern California in 1994 and are now established throughout southern California and in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley . Although its 'killer' reputation has been greatly exaggerated,  the  presence  of  AHB  will  increase  the  chances  of  people  being  stung. Learning  about  AHB  and  taking  certain  precautions  can  lower  the  risk  of  being injured by this new insect in our environment. The Africanized honey bee is closely related to the European honey bee used in agriculture for crop pollination and honey production. The two types of bees look the same and their behavior is similar in many respects. Neither is likely to sting when gathering nectar and pollen from flowers, but both will sting in defense if provoked. A swarm of bees in flight or briefly at rest seldom bothers people. However, all bees become defensive when they settle and begin producing wax comb and raising young. ## AFRICANIZED AND EUROPEAN HONEY BEES

- Look the same
- Protect their nest and sting in defense
- Can sting only once
- Have the same venom
- Pollinate flowers
- Produce honey and wax

Africanized honey bees are less predictable and more defensive than European honey bees. They are more likely to defend a greater area around their nest. They respond faster in greater numbers, although each bee can sting only once. ## AFRICANIZED HONEY BEES

- Respond quickly and sting in large numbers
- Can sense a threat from people or animals 50 feet or more from nest
- Sensevibrat
- Will pursue an enemy  1 ⁄4 mile or more
-  Swarm frequently to establish new nests
- Nest in small cavities and sheltered areas

AHB nest in many locations where people may encounter them. Nesting  sites  include:  empty  boxes,  cans,  buckets

or other containers; old tires; infrequently used vehicles; lumber piles; holes and cavities in fences, trees, or the ground; sheds, garages, and other outbuildings; and low decks or spaces under buildings. Remove potential nest sites around buildings. Be careful wherever bees may be found. <!-- page_break -->

## GENERAL PRECAUTIONS

- Listen for buzzing indicating a nest or swarm of bees
- Use care when entering sheds or outbuildings where bees may nest
- Examine work area before using lawn mowers, weed cutters, and other power equipment
- Examine areas before tying up or penning pets or livestock
- Be alert when participating in all outdoor sports and activities
- Don't disturb a nest or swarm-contact a pest control company or your county UC Cooperative Extension office. - Teach children to be cautious and respectful of all bees
- Check with a doctor about bee sting kits and procedures if sensitive to bee stings
- Develop a safety plan for your home and yard
- Organize a meeting to inform neighbors about the AHB to help increase neighborhood safety

## BEE-PROOFING YOUR HOME

- Remove possible nesting sites around home and yard
- Inspect outside walls and eaves of home and outbuildings
- Seal openings larger than  1 ⁄8" in walls, around chimneys and plumbing
- Install fine screens ( 1 /8" hardware cloth) over tops of rain spouts, vents and openings in water meter/utility boxes
- From spring to fall check once or twice a week for bees entering or leaving the same area of your home or yard

As a general rule, stay away from all honey bee swarms and colonies. If bees are encountered,  get  away  quickly. While  running away,  try  to  protect  face  and eyes as much  as  possible. Take  shelter  in  a car  or  building. Water  or thick brush does not offer enough  protection. Do  not stand and  swat at bees; rapid motions will cause them to sting. ## WHAT TO DO IF STUNG

- First, go quickly to a safe area
- Then pull or scrape stingers from skin as soon as possible (the stinger pumps out most of the venom during the first minute). - Wash sting area with soap and water like any other wound
- Apply ice pack for a few minutes to relieve pain and swelling
- Seek medical attention if breathing is troubled, if stung numerous times, or if allergic to bee stings

## CONTRIBUTIONS OF EUROPEAN HONEY BEES

- Provide 80% of the bee pollination required for fruit, vegetables, flowers, and seed crops
- Pollinate  forage  crops  such  as  alfalfa  and  clover  which  are  fed  to  dairy  and  meat animals
- Produce honey, wax, and other products

Hives of European honey bees (EHB) managed by beekeepers play an important part  in  our  lives. These  bees  are  necessary  for  the  pollination  of  many  crops. One-third of our diet relies on honey bee pollination. Efforts taken to control Africanized honey bees (AHB) must assure the continued maintenance of beekeepers' hives. If EHB were eliminated in an area, the wild Africanized honey bees would quickly fill the gap. People  can  coexist  with  AHB  by  learning  about  the  bee  and its  habits, supporting beekeeping efforts and taking a few precautions. Honey  bees  are  not  the  only  stinging  insects  people  may encounter. People are often stung by other bees and wasps that look and behave differently from honey bees. If attacked by bees, leave the area quickly and find shelter in a building or car! picture_counter_5 no image summary
