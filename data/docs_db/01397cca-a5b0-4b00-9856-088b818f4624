## MANAGING CORN ROOTWORMS STARTS TODAY. <!-- page_break -->

## ASSESS THE PEST RISK. In-plant insect protection traits are the most convenient, effective way to manage corn rootworms (CRWs) and other yield-robbing insects in cornfields today. If insects develop resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) traits, insect control will become more difficult and yields will suffer. With good stewardship and Insect Resistance Management (IRM) - including the right refuge - you protect the future profitability of your farm. ## SCOUT TO ESTABLISH CRW LARVAE PRESSURE NEXT YEAR. ## WHAT TO DO

Scout for adult beetles in fields with continuous corn. Count the number of beetles on each plant. In areas where the variant of western corn rootworm (WCRW) occurs, scout for adult beetles in soybeans by using yellow sticky traps if corn will be planted the following year. ## BENEFITS

The number of adult beetles this year will help determine the potential CRW larval pressure in cornfields next year. Comparing CRW counts with local university thresholds helps determine the risk of larval damage. ## SCOUT ADULT POPULATION TO PREVENT EGG LAYING. ## WHAT TO DO

Scout weekly to understand population trends. Compare with local threshold levels to determine if foliar sprays should be applied to control adult beetles. ## BENEFITS

Understanding fluctuations in populations helps in making decisions about insecticide applications. Foliar sprays should be applied to reduce adult beetle populations to prevent egg laying. Timing is critical with these applications. ## SCOUT TO PROTECT PLANTS AT POLLINATION. ## WHAT TO DO

If adult beetles have reached the local threshold and are clipping silks during pollination, apply foliar spray. ## BENEFITS

Adult beetles are attracted to pollen and fresh silk. They interfere with corn pollination by clipping silks during pollination, resulting in poorly filled ears. Foliar spray protects pollination. ## DIG ROOTS TO LOOK FOR LARVAL DAMAGE. ## WHAT TO DO

Examining roots helps determine the extent of larval damage. Dig roots after pollination. Refer to the node-injury scale to understand the level of pressure. ## BENEFITS

Root digs show whether the management tactics implemented in the past year were successful. Based on level of larval damage, a change in management practices may be needed to further control CRWs. ## BE AWARE OF BT TRAIT PERFORMANCE. ## BENEFITS

When WCRW becomes resistant to Bt proteins, a change of management practices is required. Look to the next page on how to manage rootworm populations. ## WHAT TO DO

Watch for documented cases of WCRW resistance to Bt proteins in the area. In your fields, monitor for unexpected WCRW damage.
