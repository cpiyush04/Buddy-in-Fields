Figure 6 . Armyworm with egg of parasitic fly. Predators : Predators such as ground beetles and rove beetles may help reduce armyworm populations. Cultural Controls : Destroying grassy weeds, one to two weeks before seeding, will minimize the risk of attracting egg-laying moths and subsequent infestations. Avoiding late termination of grass cover crops can reduce the attractiveness of fields to egg-laying moths. Revised: January 2024 John Gavloski, Entomologist, Manitoba Agriculture.
