While major resistance genes have not yet been identified in H. zea , evidence for minor resistance genes has been reported (Burd et al. 2003),  indicating  that  evolution  of  resistance  may  occur  gradually with multiple alleles with minor effects involved (Caprio and Sumerford 2007). Recent work has identified a decrease in Cry1Ac activation  as  a  mechanism  of  resistance  to  Cry1Ac  (Zhang  et  al. 2019). Resistance monitoring for many years among H. zea populations  collected  in  cotton  across  the  southeastern  United  States documented a range of susceptibility to Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab2, with some populations being significantly more resistant than a laboratory colony (Ali et al. 2006, Luttrell and Ali 2009). Populations collected  across  the  southeastern  and  southern  United  States  in  corn have  shown  resistance  to  Cry1A.105  and  Cry2Ab2  (Bilbo  et  al. 2019, Kaur et al. 2019). Recent reports of resistance to Bt cotton expressing  two  Cry  toxins  for H. zea control  have  led  to  recommendations by extension entomologists to consider the need for supplemental foliar insecticide sprays (Reisig et al. 2018). Helicoverpa zea is a major economic pest of cotton in the United States (Luttrell and  Jackson  2012). While  Bt  cotton  is  still  effective  in  managing the tobacco budworm, Chloridea virescens (Fabricius), field-evolved resistance  to  Cry  toxins  in H. zea is  a  major  concern  for  cotton production. A recent study documented a decline in efficacy of sweet corn expressing Cry1Ab from 1996 to 2016 and Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 from  2010  to  2016  in  Maryland,  and  resistance  to  Cry1Ab  was

confirmed using laboratory bioassays (Dively et al. 2016). In field corn, evidence of resistance evolving to Cry1Ab in H. zea has also been shown in North and South Carolina (Reisig and Reay-Jones 2015). Kernel damage by H. zea feeding  has  also  increased  in  recent  years  in  Bt  corn  expressing  Cry1A.105  and  Cry2Ab2  in  the southeastern United States (F.P.F. Reay-Jones and D. D. Reisig, unpublished data). With only Vip3A20 expressed at a near-high dose for H. zea in corn (Burkness et al. 2010), the development of resistance to this toxin is a major concern in both corn and cotton, where the toxin is included in recent triple-toxin varieties (Reisig and Kurtz 2018). This concern was recently substantiated by the recovery of H. zea pupae from corn expressing Cry1Ab + Cry1F + Vip3A20 in North Carolina (Bilbo et al. 2018) and South Carolina (F.P.F. ReayJones and D. D. Reisig, unpublished data). The development of resistance by target pests is a major threat to Bt crops (Onstad 2008, Carrière et al. 2010). Insect resistance management (IRM) practices have been developed to delay the development of resistance to among target pests. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines IRM as a 'practices aimed at reducing the potential for insect pests to become resistant to  a  pesticide'  (USEPA  2001). Among  tactics  proposed  for  IRM of Bt crops, the following have been suggested: 1) moderate toxin dosage levels to lead to the survival of a fraction of susceptible insects; 2) high-dose toxin to kill insects heterozygous for resistance; 3)  pyramiding  toxins  with  independent  modes  of  action;  4)  temporal  or  tissue-specific  toxin  expression;  and  5)  use  of  nontoxic refuge plants (Bates et al. 2005). In practice, many of these tactics are combined to form an IRM strategy. IRM for Bt corn products in North America targeting O. nubilalis initially implemented the 'high dose/refuge' strategy which involves expression of a high dose toxin to kill insects heterozygous for resistance combined with the use  of  nontoxic  (refuge)  plants  to  provide  susceptible  individuals to mate with rare resistant individuals emerging from the Bt crop (Gould 1998, Tabashnik 2008). The refuge in non-cotton growing areas currently consists of 20% for single-toxin Bt hybrids or 5% for  pyramids. In  cotton  growing  counties,  the  refuge  consists  of 50% for single-toxin Bt hybrids or 20% for pyramids. All Bt products targeting O. nubilalis still  provide excellent levels of control, with no indication of resistance  (Huang et al. 2011). Two major factors that led to this success are 1) the high dose of commercial Bt traits against O. nubilalis and 2) the low initial Bt resistance allele frequency. For H. zea ,  IRM has been confronted with several issues that are likely reasons for widespread resistance currently observed to several Cry toxins. First, the high-dose criteria that was successfully used for O. nubilalis was never met with H. zea (Storer et al. 2001, Tabashnik et al. 2013), as the insect is inherently more tolerant of Cry toxins. Another issue is that pyramids of Bt corn and cotton that express multiple Bt toxins contain Cry toxins that were either widely used in single-toxin Bt traits for many years (such as Cry1Ab and Cry1F) or are similar and/or cross-resistant to these Cry toxins (Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab) (Welch et al. 2015). The value of using pyramids that express Bt toxins with different modes of action has never fully been realized, even though Vip3A20 was never included in single-toxin Bt corn prior to being included in pyramids. In addition,  a  lack  of  compliance  with  non-Bt  corn  refuge  has  further jeopardized IRM (Reisig 2017, Reisig and Kurtz 2018). Finally, the majority of cotton planted in the United States expressed Bt toxins that are either the same or very similar as those in corn (Von Kanel et al. 2016), which prolongs exposure of the polyphagous H. zea to Bt toxins during a growing season and increases the risk of resistance development. ## Conclusion

A number of studies have shown that H. zea is generally not considered an economic pest when corn is planted within recommended planting  windows  (Buntin  et  al. 2001,  2004;  Bowen  et  al.
