However, late-planted corn can sometimes benefit from protection, as the risk of damage from H. zea is greater (Buntin  et  al. 2001,  2004). In  addition  to  impacts  on  yield,  corn earworm injury to ears may provide a pathway for fungal colonization, leading to greater levels of the two major types of mycotoxins, fumonisins and aflatoxins, which are a major concern for human and animal health (Widstrom 1996, Munkvold 2003). However, association between ear injury and concentrations of fumonisins and aflatoxins are generally weak (Bibb et al. 2018). ## Non-transgenic Control Tactics

## Host Plant Resistance

Tolerance,  non-preference,  and  antibiosis  have  been  identified  as mechanisms  of  resistance  to H. zea in  corn  (Wiseman  and  Davis 1990). A long tight silk channel with silk that is able to maintain a high level of moisture, husk tightness, and short husk length have been shown to reduce kernel injury by preventing H. zea larvae from moving onto the ear (Wiseman et al. 1977, Rector et al. 2002, Ni et al.
