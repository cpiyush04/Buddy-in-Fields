The eggs hatch in one to two weeks. The larvae (Figures 1 and 2) feed mainly at night on the leaves and crowns of their hosts. During the day, they rest at the base of the host plants. Larvae typically go through six stages (called instars), except the occasional larva that will go through seven, particularly in cooler temperatures. Mature larvae are 3 to 3.5 cm long. The length of time armyworms spend as larvae depends on the temperature. In studies where larvae were kept at a constant temperature, larval stages lasted 16 days at 29 degrees Celsius, 26 days at 21 degrees Celsius, and 40 days at 17 degrees Celsius. First instar larvae loop as they move, and at the slightest disturbance drop from the plant on a fine web and hang suspended and motionless.
