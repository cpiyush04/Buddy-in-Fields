The  following guidelines are recommended during monitoring;

1. Start monitoring your garden two weeks after planting and continuously visit your garden every 3 days. 2. Walk through the maize garden in either a X, Zig Zag or any other pattern while avoiding the edges of your garden
3. Randomly select 5 spots (per acre) in your garden. The spots should be spread out through your garden. Carefully examine 10 maize plants at each spot for signs and symptoms paying attention  to  the  newest  2  -  3  leaves,  tassels  and  cobs. It  is  important  to  note  that  FAW caterpillars and moths hide inside the maize funnel during the day so check the funnel. 4. Record the number of  affected maize plants from each spot
5. Take immediate action if the Fall armyworm is present in your garden. Alert your neighbours and follow appropriate control measures as described in the next section of this document or consult your Agriculture Officer
6. Check for presence of FAW on other alternate hosts like sorghum, sugar cane, rice, millet and pasture grasses (rhodes grass and elephant grass). 7. Pheromone traps can also be used for monitoring the presence of FAW in the garden. If you notice the presence of the male FAW moth in the trap, take appropriate control measures as described in the next section of this document

| Egg                            |  Eggs are creamish white or grey in color covered by a whitish wool-like material  Eggs are laid in clusters between 100 - 200 eggs per cluster usually on the upper, lower sides of the leaf, the stalk and the funnel of the maize plant  Eggs hatch within 2-3 days after being laid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |           |
| Caterpillars (6 instar stages) |  The young caterpillars spin silken threads that they use to move from one plant to another aided by wind.  Newly hatched caterpillars are green in colour during the1 st - 2 nd instars and turn brown to black from 3 rd - 6 th instar.
