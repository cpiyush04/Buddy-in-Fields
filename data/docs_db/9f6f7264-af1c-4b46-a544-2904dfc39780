## Background

Spodoptera species (armyworms) are a group of moths that contain some major global plant pests and a number of these are regulated as quarantine pests. Many species are destructive pests of tropical and subtropical agriculture and have the potential to be serious pests of glasshouse crops in temperate regions. The caterpillars of these moths feed on a wide range of plants. Caterpillars of the genus Spodoptera are known as "armyworms", because of the behaviour of the caterpillars of certain species that move in large numbers from one location to another when searching for food. Under the right conditions' certain species of Spodoptera can reach very high population levels. Certain populations can also be resistant to pesticides and, if they become well established, can be difficult to eradicate or control. Recently the genus Spodoptera has gained a lot of publicity due to the rapid spread and high levels of damage caused by the fall armyworm ( S. frugiperda ) across Africa and Asia. ## Geographical Distribution

Spodoptera species have a global distribution and can be found on all continents except Antarctica. Some species such as Spodoptera exigua are cosmopolitan in their distribution due to movement by trade. Out of the current 30 species of Spodoptera described, the majority, 18, are found in the Americas. Three species are present in Europe, seven in Africa and two in Asia.
